# MQTT

The **MQTT** input plugin, allows to retrieve messages/data from MQTT control packets over a TCP connection. The incoming data to receive _must_ be a JSON map.

## Configuration Parameters

The plugin supports the following configuration parameters:

| Key | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Listen | Listener network interface, default: 0.0.0.0 |
| Port | TCP port where listening for connections, default: 1883 |

## Getting Started

In order to start listening for MQTT messages, you can run the plugin from the command line or through the configuration file:

### Command Line

Since the **MQTT** input plugin let Fluent Bit behave as a server, we need to dispatch some messages using some MQTT client, in the following example _mosquitto_ tool is being used for the purpose:

```bash
$ fluent-bit -i mqtt -t data -o stdout -m '*'
Fluent-Bit v0.8.0

[0] data: [1463775773, {"topic"=>"some/topic", "key1"=>123, "key2"=>456}]
```

The following command line will send a message to the **MQTT** input plugin:

```bash
$ mosquitto_pub  -m '{"key1": 123, "key2": 456}' -t some/topic
```

### Configuration File

In your main configuration file append the following _Input_ & _Output_ sections:

```python
[INPUT]
    Name   mqtt
    Tag    data
    Listen 0.0.0.0
    Port   1883

[OUTPUT]
    Name   stdout
