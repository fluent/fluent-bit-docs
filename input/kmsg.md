# Kernel Log Buffer

The **kmsg** input plugin reads the Linux Kernel log buffer since the beginning, it gets every record and parse it field as priority, sequence, seconds, useconds, and message.

## Getting Started

In order to start getting the Linux Kernel messages, you can run the plugin from the command line or through the configuration file:

### Command Line

```bash
$ bin/fluent-bit -i kmsg -t kernel -o stdout -m '*'

[0] kernel: [1463421823, {"priority"=>3, "sequence"=>1814, "sec"=>11706, "usec"=>732233, "msg"=>"ERROR @wl_cfg80211_get_station : Wrong Mac address, mac = 34:a8:4e:d3:40:ec profile =20:3a:07:9e:4a:ac"}]
[1] kernel: [1463421823, {"priority"=>3, "sequence"=>1815, "sec"=>11706, "usec"=>732300, "msg"=>"ERROR @wl_cfg80211_get_station : Wrong Mac address, mac = 34:a8:4e:d3:40:ec profile =20:3a:07:9e:4a:ac"}]
[2] kernel: [1463421829, {"priority"=>3, "sequence"=>1816, "sec"=>11712, "usec"=>729728, "msg"=>"ERROR @wl_cfg80211_get_station : Wrong Mac address, mac = 34:a8:4e:d3:40:ec profile =20:3a:07:9e:4a:ac"}]
[3] kernel: [1463421829, {"priority"=>3, "sequence"=>1817, "sec"=>11712, "usec"=>729802, "msg"=>"ERROR @wl_cfg80211_get_station : Wrong Mac address, mac = 34:a8:4e:d3:40:ec

```

As described above, the plugin processed all messages that the Linux Kernel reported, the output has been truncated for clarification.
