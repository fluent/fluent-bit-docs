# Introduction to stream processing

![](../.gitbook/assets/stream_processor.png)

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io) is a fast and flexible Log processor that collects, parses, filters and delivers logs to remote databases, so that data analysis can be performed.

Data analysis usually happens after the data is stored and indexed in a database. However, for real-time and complex analysis needs, you can process the data while it's still in motion in the log processor. This approach is called **stream processing on the edge**.
