[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io) is a fast and flexible Log processor that aims to collect, parse, filter and deliver logs to remote databases, so Data Analysis can be performed.

Data Analysis usually this happens after the data is stored and indexed in a database, but for real-time and complex analysis needs, process the data while it's still in motion in the Log processor brings a lot of advantages and this approach is called **Stream Processing on the Edge**.
