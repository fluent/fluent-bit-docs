![Fluent Bit stream processing](../.gitbook/assets/stream_processor.png)

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io) is a fast & flexible log processor that aims to collect, parse, filter, and deliver logs to remote databases so data analysis can be performed.

Data analysis usually happens after the data is stored and indexed in a database. However, for real-time and complex analysis needs, processing the data while it's still in motion in the log processor brings a lot of advantages. This approach is called **Stream Processing on the Edge**.
