# Scheduling and Retries

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io) has an Engine that helps to coordinate the data ingestion from input plugins and call the _Scheduler_ to decide when is time to flush the data through one or multiple output plugins. The Scheduler flush new data every a fixed time of seconds and Schedule retries when asked.

Once an output plugin gets call to flush some data, after processing that data it can notify the Engine three possible return statuses:

* OK
* Retry
* Error

If the return status was **OK**, it means it was successfully able to process and flush the data, if it returned an **Error** status, means that an unrecoverable error happened and the engine should not try to flush that data again. If a **Retry** was requested, the _Engine_ will ask the _Scheduler_ to retry to flush that data, the Scheduler will decide how many seconds to wait before that happen.

## Configuring Retries

The Scheduler provides a simple configuration option called **Retry\_Limit** which can be set independently on each output section. This option allows to disable retries or impose a limit to try N times and then discard the data after reaching that limit:

|  | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Retry\_Limit | N | Integer value to set the maximum number of retries allowed. N must be &gt;= 1 \(default: 2\) |
| Retry\_Limit | False | When Retry\_Limit is set to False, means that there is not limit for the number of retries that the Scheduler can do. |

### Example

The following example configure two outputs where the HTTP plugin have an unlimited number of retries and the Elasticsearch plugin have a limit of 5 times:

```text
[OUTPUT]
    Name        http
    Host        192.168.5.6
    Port        8080
    Retry_Limit False

[OUTPUT]
    Name            es
    Host            192.168.5.20
    Port            9200
    Logstash_Format On
    Retry_Limit     5
```
