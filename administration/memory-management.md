# Memory management

You might need to estimate how much memory Fluent Bit could be using in scenarios
like containerized environments where memory limits are essential.

To make an estimate, in-use input plugins must set the `Mem_Buf_Limit`option.
Learn more about it in [Backpressure](backpressure.md).

## Estimating

Input plugins append data independently. To make an estimation, impose a limit with
the `Mem_Buf_Limit` option. If the limit was set to `10MB`, you can estimate that in
the worst case, the output plugin likely could use `20MB`.

Fluent Bit has an internal binary representation for the data being processed. When
this data reaches an output plugin, it can create its own representation in a new
memory buffer for processing. The best examples are the
[InfluxDB](../pipeline/outputs/influxdb.md) and
[Elasticsearch](../pipeline/outputs/elasticsearch.md) output plugins, which need to
convert the binary representation to their respective custom JSON formats before
sending data to the backend servers.

When imposing a limit of `10MB` for the input plugins, and a worst case scenario of
the output plugin consuming `20MB`, you need to allocate a minimum (`30MB` x 1.2) =
`36MB`.

## Glibc and memory fragmentation

In intensive environments where memory allocations happen in the orders of magnitude,
the default memory allocator provided by Glibc could lead to high fragmentation,
reporting a high memory usage by the service.

It's strongly suggested that in any production environment, Fluent Bit should be
built with [jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net/) enabled (`-DFLB_JEMALLOC=On`).
The jemalloc implementation of malloc is an alternative memory allocator that can
reduce fragmentation, resulting in better performance.

Use the following command to determine if Fluent Bit has been built with jemalloc:

```bash
bin/fluent-bit -h | grep JEMALLOC
```

The output should look like:

```text
Build Flags =  JSMN_PARENT_LINKS JSMN_STRICT FLB_HAVE_TLS FLB_HAVE_SQLDB
FLB_HAVE_TRACE FLB_HAVE_FLUSH_LIBCO FLB_HAVE_VALGRIND FLB_HAVE_FORK
FLB_HAVE_PROXY_GO FLB_HAVE_JEMALLOC JEMALLOC_MANGLE FLB_HAVE_REGEX
FLB_HAVE_C_TLS FLB_HAVE_SETJMP FLB_HAVE_ACCEPT4 FLB_HAVE_INOTIFY
```

If the `FLB_HAVE_JEMALLOC` option is listed in `Build Flags`, jemalloc is enabled.
