# Fluent Bit YAML Configuration

## Before You Get Started

Fluent Bit traditionally offered a `classic` configuration mode, a custom configuration format that we are gradually phasing out. While `classic` mode has served well for many years, it has several limitations. Its basic design only supports grouping sections with key-value pairs and lacks the ability to handle sub-sections or complex data structures like lists.

YAML, now a mainstream configuration format, has become essential in a cloud ecosystem where everything is configured this way. To minimize friction and provide a more intuitive experience for creating data pipelines, we strongly encourage users to transition to YAML. The YAML format enables features, such as processors, that are not possible to configure in `classic` mode.

As of Fluent Bit v3.2, you can configure everything in YAML.

## List of Available Sections

Configuring Fluent Bit with YAML introduces the following root-level sections:

| Section Name         |Description                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `service`            | Describes the global configuration for the Fluent Bit service. This section is optional; if not set, default values will apply. Only one `service` section can be defined. |
| `parsers`            | Lists parsers to be used by components like inputs, processors, filters, or output plugins. You can define multiple `parsers` sections, which can also be loaded from external files included in the main YAML configuration. |
| `multiline_parsers`  | Lists multiline parsers, functioning similarly to `parsers`. Multiple definitions can exist either in the root or in included files.                    |
| `pipeline`           | Defines a pipeline composed of inputs, processors, filters, and output plugins. You can define multiple `pipeline` sections, but they will not operate independently. Instead, all components will be merged into a single pipeline internally. |
| `plugins`            | Specifies the path to external plugins (.so files) to be loaded by Fluent Bit at runtime.                                                              |
| `upstream_servers`          | Refers to a group of node endpoints that can be referenced by output plugins that support this feature.                                                |
| `env`                | Sets a list of environment variables for Fluent Bit. Note that system environment variables are available, while the ones defined in the configuration apply only to Fluent Bit. |
