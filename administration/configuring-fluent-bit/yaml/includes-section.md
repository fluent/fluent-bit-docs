# Includes

The `includes` section lets you specify additional YAML configuration files to be merged into the current configuration. These files are identified as a list of filenames and can include relative or absolute paths. If no absolute path is provided, the file is assumed to be located in a directory relative to the file that references it.

Use this section to organize complex configurations into smaller, manageable files and include them as needed.

## Usage

The following example demonstrates how to include additional YAML files using relative path references. This is the file system path structure:

```text
├── fluent-bit.yaml
├── inclusion-1.yaml
└── subdir
    └── inclusion-2.yaml
```

The content of `fluent-bit.yaml`:

```yaml
includes:
  - inclusion-1.yaml
  - subdir/inclusion-2.yaml
```

Ensure that the included files are formatted correctly and contain valid YAML configurations for seamless integration.

If a path isn't specified as absolute, it will be treated as relative to the file that includes it.
