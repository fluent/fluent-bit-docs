## Configuration Parameters

| Key           | Description                                                  | default    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Format        | Specify data format, options available: json, msgpack.       | json       |
| Message_Key   | Optional key to store the message                            |            |
| Timestamp_Key | Set the key to store the record timestamp                    | @timestamp |
| Brokers       | Single of multiple list of Kafka Brokers, e.g: 192.168.1.3:9092, 192.168.1.4:9092. |            |
| Topics        | Single entry or list of topics separated by comma (,) that Fluent Bit will use to send messages to Kafka. If only one topic is set, that one will be used for all records. Instead if multiple topics exists, the one set in the record by Topic_Key will be used. | fluent-bit |
| Topic_Key     | If multiple Topics exists, the value of Topic_Key in the record will indicate the topic to use. E.g: if Topic_Key is _router_ and the record is {"key1": 123, "router": "route_2"}, Fluent Bit will use topic _route_2_. Note that if the value of Topic_Key is not present in Topics, then by default the first topic in the Topics list will indicate the topic to be used. |            |

```
$ fluent-bit -i cpu -o kafka -p brokers=192.168.1.3:9092 -p topics=test
```

### Configuration File

In your main configuration file append the following *Input* & *Output* sections:

```
[INPUT]
    Name  cpu

[OUTPUT]
    Name        kafka
