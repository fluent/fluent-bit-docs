# Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)

The Kusto output plugin allows to ingest your logs into an [Azure Data Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-explorer/) cluster, via the [Queued Ingestion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/about-kusto-ingest#queued-ingestion) mechanism. This output plugin can also be used to ingest logs into an [Eventhouse](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/eventhouse-overview-handling-real-time-data-with-microsoft-fabric/) cluster in Microsoft Fabric Real Time Analytics.

## For ingesting into Azure Data Explorer:  Creating a Kusto Cluster and Database

You can create an Azure Data Explorer cluster in one of the following ways:

- [Create a free-tier cluster](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/freecluster)
- [Create a fully featured cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/create-cluster-database-portal)

## For ingesting into Microsoft Fabric Real Time Analytics : Creating an Eventhouse Cluster and KQL Database

You can create an Eventhouse cluster and a KQL database follow the following steps:

- [Create an Eventhouse cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/eventhouse/create-eventhouse-cluster)
- [Create a KQL database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/eventhouse/create-database)

## Creating an Azure Registered Application

Fluent-Bit will use the application's credentials, to ingest data into your cluster.

- [Register an Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application)
- [Add a client secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret)
- [Authorize the app in your database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/access-control/principals-and-identity-providers#azure-ad-tenants)

## Creating a Table

Fluent-Bit ingests the event data into Kusto in a JSON format, that by default will include 3 properties:

- `log` - the actual event payload.
- `tag` - the event tag.
- `timestamp` - the event timestamp.

A table with the expected schema must exist in order for data to be ingested properly.

```kql
.create table FluentBit (log:dynamic, tag:string, timestamp:datetime)
```

## Optional - Creating an Ingestion Mapping

By default, Kusto will insert incoming ingestions into a table by inferring the mapped table columns, from the payload properties. However, this mapping can be customized by creatng a [JSON ingestion mapping](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/mappings#json-mapping). The plugin can be configured to use an ingestion mapping via the `ingestion_mapping_reference` configuration key.

## Troubleshooting

### 403 Forbidden

If you get a `403 Forbidden` error response, make sure that:

- You provided the correct AAD registered application credentials.
- You authorized the application to ingest into your database or table.
