# Chronicle

The Chronicle output plugin allows ingesting security logs into [Google Chronicle](https://chronicle.security/) service. This connector is designed to send unstructured security logs.

## Google Cloud Configuration

Fluent Bit streams data into an existing Google Chronicle tenant using a service account that you specify. Therefore, before using the Chronicle output plugin, you must create a service account, create a Google Chronicle tenant, authorize the service account to write to the tenant, and provide the service account credentials to Fluent Bit.

### Creating a Service Account

To stream security logs into Google Chronicle, the first step is to create a Google Cloud service account for Fluent Bit:

* [Creating a Google Cloud Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts)

### Creating a Tenant of Google Chronicle

Fluent Bit does not create a tenant of Google Chronicle for your security logs, so you must create this ahead of time.

### Retrieving Service Account Credentials

Fluent Bit's Chronicle output plugin uses a JSON credentials file for authentication credentials. Download the credentials file by following these instructions:

* [Creating and Managing Service Account Keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys)
