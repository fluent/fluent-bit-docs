# Google Chronicle

The _Google Chronicle_ output plugin lets you ingest security logs into the [Google Chronicle](https://chronicle.security/) service. This connector is designed to send unstructured security logs.

## Google Cloud configuration

Fluent Bit streams data into an existing Google Chronicle tenant using a service account that you specify. Before using the Chronicle output plugin, you must:

1. Create a service account.

   To stream security logs into Google Chronicle, create a [Google Cloud service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) for Fluent Bit:

1. Create a tenant of Google Chronicle.

   Fluent Bit doesn't create a tenant of Google Chronicle for your security logs, so you must create this ahead of time.

1. Retrieve service account credentials.

   The Fluent Bit Chronicle output plugin uses a JSON credentials file for authentication credentials. Download the credentials file by following the instructions for [Creating and Managing Service Account Keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).
