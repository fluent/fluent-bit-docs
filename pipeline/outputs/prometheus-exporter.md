description: An output plugin to expose Prometheus Metrics

# Prometheus Exporter

The prometheus exporter allows you to take metrics from Fluent Bit and expose them such that a Prometheus instance can scrape them.

Important Note: The prometheus exporter only works with metric  plugins, such as Node Exporter Metrics

| Key | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| host | This is address Fluent Bit will bind to when hosting prometheus metrics. Note: `listen` parameter is deprecated from v1.9.0. | 0.0.0.0 |
| port | This is the port Fluent Bit will bind to when hosting prometheus metrics | 2021 |
| add\_label | This allows you to add custom labels to all metrics exposed through the prometheus exporter. You may have multiple of these fields |  |
| workers | The number of [workers](../../administration/multithreading.md#outputs) to perform flush operations for this output. | `1` |

## Getting Started

The Prometheus exporter only works with metrics captured from metric plugins. In the following example, host metrics are captured by the node exporter metrics plugin and then are routed to prometheus exporter. Within the output plugin two labels are added `app="fluent-bit"`and `color="blue"`
