# Amazon S3

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

The Amazon S3 output plugin allows you to ingest your records into the [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) cloud object store.

The plugin can upload data to S3 using the [multipart upload API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html) or using S3 [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API\_PutObject.html). Multipart is the default and is recommended; Fluent Bit will stream data in a series of 'parts'. This limits the amount of data it has to buffer on disk at any point in time. By default, every time 5 MiB of data have been received, a new 'part' will be uploaded. The plugin can create files up to gigabytes in size from many small chunks/parts using the multipart API. All aspects of the upload process are configurable using the configuration options.

The plugin allows you to specify a maximum file size, and a timeout for uploads. A file will be created in S3 when the max size is reached, or the timeout is reached- whichever comes first.

Records are stored in files in S3 as newline delimited JSON.

See [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-docs/tree/43c4fe134611da471e706b0edb2f9acd7cdfdbc3/administration/aws-credentials.md) for details on how AWS credentials are fetched.

**NOTE**: *The [Prometheus success/retry/error metrics values](administration/monitoring.md) outputted by Fluent Bit's built-in http server are meaningless for the S3 output*. This is because S3 has its own buffering and retry mechanisms. The Fluent Bit AWS S3 maintainers apologize for this feature gap; you can [track our progress fixing it on GitHub](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/issues/6141).

| s3\_key\_format                  | Format string for keys in S3. This option supports a UUID, strftime time formatters, a syntax for selecting parts of the Fluent log tag using a syntax inspired by the rewrite\_tag filter. Add $UUID in the format string to insert a random string. Add $INDEX in the format string to insert an integer that increments each upload. Add $TAG in the format string to insert the full log tag; add $TAG\[0] to insert the first part of the tag in the s3 key. The tag is split into “parts” using the characters specified with the `s3_key_format_tag_delimiters` option. Add extension directly after the last piece of the format string to insert a key suffix. If you want to specify a key suffix and you are in `use_put_object` mode, you must specify $UUID as well. More explanations can be found in `use_put_object` option. See the in depth examples and tutorial in the documentation. | /fluent-bit-logs/$TAG/%Y/%m/%d/%H/%M/%S |
| s3\_key\_format\_tag\_delimiters | A series of characters which will be used to split the tag into 'parts' for use with the s3\_key\_format option.

### TLS / SSL

To skip TLS verification, set `tls.verify` as `false`. For more details about the properties available and general configuration, please refer to the [TLS/SSL](../../administration/security.md) section.

## Permissions

The plugin requires the following AWS IAM permissions:

```
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [{
		"Effect": "Allow",
		"Action": [
			"s3:PutObject"
		],
		"Resource": "*"
	}]
}
```

## S3 Key Format and Tag Delimiters

In Fluent Bit, all logs have an associated tag. The `s3_key_format` option lets you inject the tag into the s3 key using the following syntax:

* `$TAG` => the full tag
* `$TAG[n]` => the nth part of the tag (index starting at zero). This syntax is copied from the rewrite tag filter. By default, “parts” of the tag are separated with dots, but you can change this with `s3_key_format_tag_delimiters`.

In the example below, assume the date is January 1st, 2020 00:00:00 and the tag associated with the logs in question is `my_app_name-logs.prod`.

```
[OUTPUT]
    Name                         s3
    Match                        *
    bucket                       my-bucket
    region                       us-west-2
    total_file_size              250M
    s3_key_format                /$TAG[2]/$TAG[0]/%Y/%m/%d/%H/%M/%S/$UUID.gz
    s3_key_format_tag_delimiters .-
```

With the delimiters as . and -, the tag will be split into parts as follows:

* `$TAG[0]` = my\_app\_name
* `$TAG[1]` = logs
* `$TAG[2]` = prod

So the key in S3 will be `/prod/my_app_name/2020/01/01/00/00/00/bgdHN1NM.gz`.

### Reliability

The `store_dir` is used to temporarily store data before it is uploaded. If Fluent Bit is stopped suddenly it will try to send all data and complete all uploads before it shuts down. If it can not send some data, on restart it will look in the `store_dir` for existing data and will try to send it.

Multipart uploads are ideal for most use cases because they allow the plugin to upload data in small chunks over time. For example, 1 GB file can be created from 200 5MB chunks. While the file size in S3 will be 1 GB, only 5 MB will be buffered on disk at any one point in time.

There is one minor drawback to multipart uploads- the file and data will not be visible in S3 until the upload is completed with a [CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API\_CompleteMultipartUpload.html) call. The plugin will attempt to make this call whenever Fluent Bit is shut down to ensure your data is available in s3. It will also store metadata about each upload in the `store_dir`, ensuring that uploads can be completed when Fluent Bit restarts (assuming it has access to persistent disk and the `store_dir` files will still be present on restart).

#### Using S3 without persisted disk

If you run Fluent Bit in an environment without persistent disk, or without the ability to restart Fluent Bit and give it access to the data stored in the `store_dir` from previous executions- some considerations apply. This might occur if you run Fluent Bit on [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/).

In these situations, we recommend using the PutObject API, and sending data frequently, to avoid local buffering as much as possible. This will limit data loss in the event Fluent Bit is killed unexpectedly.

The following settings are recommended for this use case:

```
[OUTPUT]
     Name s3
     Match *
     bucket your-bucket
     region us-east-1
     total_file_size 1M
     upload_timeout 1m
     use_put_object On
```

### Worker support

Fluent Bit 1.7 adds a new feature called `workers` which enables outputs to have dedicated threads. This `s3` plugin has partial support for workers. **The plugin can only support a single worker; enabling multiple workers will lead to errors/indeterminate behavior.**

Example:

```
[OUTPUT]
     Name s3
     Match *
     bucket your-bucket
     region us-east-1
     total_file_size 1M
     upload_timeout 1m
     use_put_object On
     workers 1
```

If you enable a single worker, you are enabling a dedicated thread for your S3 output. We recommend starting without workers, evaluating the performance, and then enabling a worker if needed. For most users, the plugin can provide sufficient throughput without workers.

### Usage with MinIO

[MinIO](https://min.io/) is a high-performance, S3 compatible object storage and you can build your app with S3 functionality without S3.

Assume you run [a MinIO server](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html) at localhost:9000, and create a bucket of `your-bucket` by referring [the client docs](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide).

Example:

```
[OUTPUT]
     Name s3
     Match *
     bucket your-bucket
     endpoint http://localhost:9000
```

Then, the records will be stored into the MinIO server.

## Getting Started

In order to send records into Amazon S3, you can run the plugin from the command line or through the configuration file.

### Command Line

The **s3** plugin, can read the parameters from the command line through the **-p** argument (property), e.g:

```
$ fluent-bit -i cpu -o s3 -p bucket=my-bucket -p region=us-west-2 -p -m '*' -f 1
```

### Configuration File

In your main configuration file append the following _Output_ section:

```
[OUTPUT]
     Name s3
     Match *
     bucket your-bucket
     region us-east-1
     store_dir /home/ec2-user/buffer
     total_file_size 50M
     upload_timeout 10m
```

An example that using PutObject instead of multipart:

```
[OUTPUT]
     Name s3
     Match *
     bucket your-bucket
     region us-east-1
     store_dir /home/ec2-user/buffer
     use_put_object On
     total_file_size 10M
     upload_timeout 10m
```

## Advanced usage

### Use Apache Arrow for in-memory data processing

Starting from Fluent Bit v1.8, the Amazon S3 plugin includes the support for [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/). The support is currently not enabled by default, as it depends on a shared version of `libarrow` as the prerequisite.

To use this feature, `FLB_ARROW` must be turned on at compile time:

```
$ cd build/
$ cmake -DFLB_ARROW=On ..
$ cmake --build .
```

Once compiled, Fluent Bit can upload incoming data to S3 in Apache Arrow format. For example:

```
[INPUT]
  Name cpu

[OUTPUT]
  Name s3
  Bucket your-bucket-name
  total_file_size 1M
  use_put_object On
  upload_timeout 60s
  Compression arrow
```

As shown in this example, setting `Compression` to `arrow` makes Fluent Bit to convert payload into Apache Arrow format.

The stored data is very easy to load, analyze and process using popular data processing tools (such as Python pandas, Apache Spark and Tensorflow). The following code uses `pyarrow` to analyze the uploaded data:

```
>>> import pyarrow.feather as feather
>>> import pyarrow.fs as fs
>>>
>>> s3 = fs.S3FileSystem()
>>> file = s3.open_input_file("my-bucket/fluent-bit-logs/cpu.0/2021/04/27/09/36/15-object969o67ZF")
