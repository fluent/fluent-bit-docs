# Amazon S3

![AWS logo](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

The Amazon S3 output plugin lets you ingest records into the
[S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html)
cloud object store.

The plugin can upload data to S3 using the
[multipart upload API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html)
or [`PutObject`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html).
Multipart is the default and is recommended. Fluent Bit will stream data in a series
of _parts_. This limits the amount of data buffered on disk at any point in time.
By default, every time 5&nbsp;MiB of data have been received, a new part will be uploaded.
The plugin can create files up to gigabytes in size from many small chunks or parts
using the multipart API. All aspects of the upload process are configurable.

The plugin lets you specify a maximum file size, and a timeout for uploads. A
file will be created in S3 when the maximum size or the timeout is reached, whichever
comes first.

Records are stored in files in S3 as newline delimited JSON.

See [AWS
Credentials](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-docs/tree/43c4fe134611da471e706b0edb2f9acd7cdfdbc3/administration/aws-credentials.md)
for details about fetching AWS credentials.

{% hint style="info" %}
The [Prometheus success/retry/error metrics values](administration/monitoring.md)
output by the built-in http server in Fluent Bit are meaningless for S3 output. S3 has
its own buffering and retry mechanisms. The Fluent Bit AWS S3 maintainers apologize
for this feature gap; you can [track our progress fixing it on GitHub](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/issues/6141).

## Configuration Parameters

| Key                | Description                       | Default     |
|--------------------| --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `region`           | The AWS region of your S3 bucket. | `us-east-1` |
| `bucket`           | S3 Bucket name                    | _none_ |
| `json_date_key`    | Specify the time key name in the output record. To disable the time key, set the value to `false`. | `date` |
| `json_date_format` | Specify the format of the date. Accepted values: `double`, `epoch`, `iso8601` (2018-05-30T09:39:52.000681Z), `_java_sql_timestamp_` (2018-05-30 09:39:52.000681). | `iso8601` |
| `total_file_size`  | Specify file size in S3. Minimum size is `1M`. With `use_put_object On` the maximum size is `1G`. With multipart uploads, the maximum size is `50G`. | `100M` |
| `upload_chunk_size` | The size of each part for multipart uploads. Max: 50M | 5,242,880 bytes  |
| `upload_timeout`   | When this amount of time elapses, Fluent Bit uploads and creates a new file in S3. Set to `60m` to upload a new file every hour. | `10m`|
| `store_dir`        | Directory to locally buffer data before sending. When  using multipart uploads, data buffers until reaching the `upload_chunk_size`. S3 stores metadata about in progress multipart uploads in this directory, allowing pending uploads to be completed if Fluent Bit stops and restarts. It stores the current `$INDEX` value if enabled in the S3 key format so the `$INDEX` keeps incrementing from its previous value after Fluent Bit restarts. | `/tmp/fluent-bit/s3` |
| `store_dir_limit_size` | Size limit for disk usage in S3. Limit theS3 buffers in the `store_dir` to limit disk usage.  Use `store_dir_limit_size` instead of `storage.total_limit_size` which can be used for other plugins | `0` (unlimited) |
| `s3_key_format`   | Format string for keys in S3. This option supports a UUID, strftime time formatters, a syntax for selecting parts of the Fluent log tag using a syntax inspired by the `rewrite_tag` filter. Add `$UUID` in the format string to insert a random string. Add `$INDEX` in the format string to insert an integer that increments each upload. The `$INDEX` value saves in the `store_dir`. Add `$TAG` in the format string to insert the full log tag. Add `$TAG[0]` to insert the first part of the tag in theS3 key. The tag is split into parts using the characters specified with the `s3_key_format_tag_delimiters` option. Add the extension directly after the last piece of the format string to insert a key suffix. To specify a key suffix in `use_put_object` mode, you must specify `$UUID`. See [S3 Key Format](#allowing-a-file-extension-in-the-s3-key-format-with-usduuid). Time in `s3_key` is the timestamp of the first record in the S3 file. | `/fluent-bit-logs/$TAG/%Y/%m/%d/%H/%M/%S` |
| `s3_key_format_tag_delimiters` | A series of characters used to split the tag into parts for use with `s3_key_format`. option. | `.` |
| `static_file_path` | Disables behavior where UUID string appendeds to the end of the S3 key name when `$UUID` is not provided in `s3_key_format`. `$UUID`, time formatters, `$TAG`, and other dynamic key formatters all work as expected while this feature is set to true. | `false` |
| `use_put_object`   | Use the S3 `PutObject` API instead of the multipart upload API. When enabled, the key extension is only available when `$UUID` is specified in `s3_key_format`. If `$UUID` isn't included, a random string appends format string and the key extension can't be customized. | `false` |
| `role_arn` | ARN of an IAM role to assume (for example, for cross account access.) | _none_ |
| `endpoint`  | Custom endpoint for the S3 API. Endpoints can contain scheme and port. | _none_ |
| `sts_endpoint` | Custom endpoint for the STS API. | _none_ |
| `profile`   | Option to specify an AWS Profile for credentials.   | `default` |
| `canned_acl` | [Predefined Canned ACL policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl) for S3 objects. | _none_ |
| `compression` | Compression type for S3 objects. `gzip` is currently the only supported value by default. If Apache Arrow support was enabled at compile time, you can use `arrow`. For gzip compression, the Content-Encoding HTTP Header will be set to `gzip`. Gzip compression can be enabled when `use_put_object` is `on` or `off` (`PutObject` and Multipart). Arrow compression can only be enabled with `use_put_object On`. | _none_ |
| `content_type` | A standard MIME type for the S3 object, set as the Content-Type HTTP header. | _none_ |
| `send_content_md5` | Send the Content-MD5 header with `PutObject` and UploadPart requests, as is required when Object Lock is enabled. | `false` |
| `auto_retry_requests` | Immediately retry failed requests to AWS services once. This option doesn't affect the normal Fluent Bit retry mechanism with backoff. Instead, it enables an immediate retry with no delay for networking errors, which may help improve throughput during transient network issues. | `true` |
| `log_key` | By default, the whole log record will be sent to S3. When specifing a key name with this option, only the value of that key sends to S3. For example, when using Docker you can specify `log_key log` and only the log message sends to S3. | _none_ |
| `preserve_data_ordering` | When an upload request fails, the last received chunk might swap with a later chunk, resulting in data shuffling. This feature prevents shuffling by using a queue logic for uploads. | `true` |
| `storage_class` | Specify the [storage class](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html#AmazonS3-PutObject-request-header-StorageClass) for S3 objects. If this option isn't specified, objects store with the default `STANDARD` storage class. | _none_ |
| `retry_limit` | Integer value to set the maximum number of retries allowed. Requires versions 1.9.10 and 2.0.1 or later. For previous version, the number of retries is `5` and isn't configurable. | `1` |
| `external_id` | Specify an external ID for the STS API. Can be used with the `role_arn` parameter if your role requires an external ID. | _none_ |
| `workers` | The number of [workers](../../administration/multithreading.md#outputs) to perform flush operations for this output. | `1` |

## TLS / SSL

To skip TLS verification, set `tls.verify` as `false`. For more details about the
properties available and general configuration, refer to
[TLS/SSL](../../administration/transport-security.md).

## Permissions

The plugin requires the following AWS IAM permissions:

```text
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "s3:PutObject"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
    }]
}
```

## Differences between S3 and other Fluent Bit outputs

The S3 output plugin is used to upload large files to an Amazon S3 bucket, while
most other outputs which send many requests to upload data in batches of a few
megabytes or less.

When Fluent Bit receives logs, it stores them in chunks, either in memory or the
filesystem depending on your settings. Chunks are usually around 2&nbsp;MB in size.
Fluent Bit sends chunks, in order, to each output that matches their tag. Most outputs
then send the chunk immediately to their destination. A chunk is sent to the output's
`flush` callback function, which must return one of `FLB_OK`, `FLB_RETRY`, or
`FLB_ERROR`. Fluent Bit keeps count of the return values from each output's
`flush` callback function. These counters are the data source for Fluent Bit's error, retry,
and success metrics available in Prometheus format through its monitoring interface.

The S3 output plugin conforms to the Fluent Bit output plugin specification.
Since S3's use case is to upload large files (over 2&nbsp;MB), its behavior is different.
S3's `flush` callback function buffers the incoming chunk to the filesystem, and
returns an `FLB_OK`. This means Prometheus metrics available from the Fluent
Bit HTTP server are meaningless for S3. In addition, the `storage.total_limit_size`
parameter is not meaningful for S3 since it has its own buffering system in the
`store_dir`. Instead, use `store_dir_limit_size`. S3 requires a writeable filesystem.
Running Fluent Bit on a read-only filesystem won't work with the S3 output.

S3 uploads primarily initiate using the S3
[`timer`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotevents/latest/apireference/API_iotevents-data_Timer.html)
callback function, which runs separately from its `flush`.

S3 has its own buffering system and its own callback to upload data, so the normal
sequential data ordering of chunks provided by the Fluent Bit engine may be
compromised. S3 has the `presevere_data_ordering` option which ensures data is
uploaded in the original order it was collected by Fluent Bit.

### Summary: Uniqueness in S3 Plugin

- The HTTP Monitoring interface output metrics are not meaningful for S3. AWS
  understands that this is non-ideal; we have
  [opened an issue with a design](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/issues/6141)
  to allow S3 to manage its own output metrics.
- You must use `store_dir_limit_size` to limit the space on disk used by S3 buffer files.
- The original ordering of data inputted to Fluent Bit may not be preserved unless you enable
`preserve_data_ordering On`.

## S3 Key Format and Tag Delimiters

In Fluent Bit, all logs have an associated tag. The `s3_key_format` option lets you
inject the tag into the S3 key using the following syntax:

- `$TAG`: The full tag.
- `$TAG[n]`: The nth part of the tag (index starting at zero). This syntax is copied
  from the rewrite tag filter. By default, “parts” of the tag are separated with
  dots, but you can change this with `s3_key_format_tag_delimiters`.

In the following example, assume the date is January 1st, 2020 00:00:00 and the tag
associated with the logs in question is `my_app_name-logs.prod`.

```python
[OUTPUT]
    Name  s3
    Match *
    bucket                       my-bucket
    region                       us-west-2
    total_file_size              250M
    s3_key_format                /$TAG[2]/$TAG[0]/%Y/%m/%d/%H/%M/%S/$UUID.gz
    s3_key_format_tag_delimiters .-
```

With the delimiters as `.` and `-`, the tag splits into parts as follows:

- `$TAG[0]` = `my_app_name`
- `$TAG[1]` = `logs`
- `$TAG[2]` = `prod`

The key in S3 will be `/prod/my_app_name/2020/01/01/00/00/00/bgdHN1NM.gz`.

### Allowing a file extension in the S3 Key Format with $UUID

The Fluent Bit S3 output was designed to ensure that previous uploads will never be
overwritten by a subsequent upload. The `s3_key_format` supports time formatters,
`$UUID`, and `$INDEX`. `$INDEX` is special because it is saved in the `store_dir`. If
you restart Fluent Bit with the same disk, it can continue incrementing the
index from its last value in the previous run.

For files uploaded with the `PutObject` API, the S3 output requires that a unique
random string be present in the S3 key. Many of the use cases for
`PutObject` uploads involve a short time period between uploads, so a timestamp
in the S3 key may not be unique enough between uploads. For example, if you only
specify minute granularity timestamps in the S3 key, with a small upload size, it is
possible to have two uploads that have timestamps set in the same minute. This
requirement can be disabled with `static_file_path On`.

The `PutObject` API is used in these cases:

- When you explicitly set `use_put_object On`.
- On startup when the S3 output finds old buffer files in the `store_dir` from
  a previous run and attempts to send all of them at once.
- On shutdown. To prevent data loss the S3 output attempts to send all currently
  buffered data at once.

You should always specify `$UUID` somewhere in your S3 key format. Otherwise, if the
`PutObject` API is used, S3 appends a random eight-character UUID to the end of your
S3 key. This means that a file extension set at the end of an S3 key will have the
random UUID appended to it. Disabled this with `static_file_path On`.

For example, we attempt to set a `.gz` extension without specifying `$UUID`:

```python
[OUTPUT]
    Name  s3
    Match *
    bucket                       my-bucket
    region                       us-west-2
    total_file_size              50M
    use_put_object               Off
    compression                  gzip
    s3_key_format                /$TAG/%Y/%m/%d/%H_%M_%S.gz
```

In the case where pending data is uploaded on shutdown, if the tag was `app`, the S3
key in the S3 bucket might be:

```text
/app/2022/12/25/00_00_00.gz-apwgylqg
```

The S3 output appended a random string to the file extension, since this upload
on shutdown used the `PutObject` API.

There are two ways of disabling this behavior:

- Use `static_file_path`:

    ```python
    [OUTPUT]
        Name  s3
        Match *
        bucket                       my-bucket
        region                       us-west-2
        total_file_size              50M
        use_put_object               Off
        compression                  gzip
        s3_key_format                /$TAG/%Y/%m/%d/%H_%M_%S.gz
        static_file_path             On
    ```

- Explicitly define where the random UUID will go in the S3 key format:

    ```python
    [OUTPUT]
        Name  s3
        Match *
        bucket                       my-bucket
        region                       us-west-2
        total_file_size              50M
        use_put_object               Off
        compression                  gzip
        s3_key_format                /$TAG/%Y/%m/%d/%H_%M_%S/$UUID.gz
    ```

## Reliability

The `store_dir` is used to temporarily store data before upload. If Fluent Bit
stops suddenly, it will try to send all data and complete all uploads before it
shuts down. If it can not send some data, on restart it will look in the `store_dir`
for existing data and try to send it.

Multipart uploads are ideal for most use cases because they allow the plugin to
upload data in small chunks over time. For example, 1&nbsp;GB file can be created
from 200 5&nbsp;MB chunks. While the file size in S3 will be 1&nbsp;GB, only
5&nbsp;MB will be buffered on disk at any one point in time.

One drawback to multipart uploads is that the file and data aren't visible in S3
until the upload is completed with a
[CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html)
call. The plugin attempts to make this call whenever Fluent Bit is shut down to
ensure your data is available in S3. It also stores metadata about each upload in
the `store_dir`, ensuring that uploads can be completed when Fluent Bit restarts
(assuming it has access to persistent disk and the `store_dir` files will still be
present on restart).

### Using S3 without persisted disk

If you run Fluent Bit in an environment without persistent disk, or without the
ability to restart Fluent Bit and give it access to the data stored in the
`store_dir` from previous executions, some considerations apply. This might occur if
you run Fluent Bit on [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/).

In these situations, we recommend using the `PutObject` API and sending data
frequently, to avoid local buffering as much as possible. This will limit data loss
in the event Fluent Bit is killed unexpectedly.

The following settings are recommended for this use case:

```python
[OUTPUT]
    Name s3
    Match *
    bucket your-bucket
    region us-east-1
    total_file_size 1M
    upload_timeout 1m
    use_put_object On
```

## S3 Multipart Uploads

With `use_put_object Off` (default), S3 will attempt to send files using multipart
uploads. For each file, S3 first calls
[CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html),
then a series of calls to
[UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html) for
each fragment (targeted to be `upload_chunk_size` bytes), and finally
[CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html)
to create the final file in S3.

### Fallback to `PutObject`

S3 [requires](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/qfacts.html) each
[UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)
fragment to be at least 5,242,880 bytes, otherwise the upload is rejected.

The S3 output must sometimes fallback to the [`PutObject`
API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_`PutObject`.html).

Uploads are triggered by these settings:

- `total_file_size` and `upload_chunk_size`: When S3 has buffered data in the
  `store_dir` that meets the desired `total_file_size` (for `use_put_object On`) or
  the `upload_chunk_size` (for Multipart), it will trigger an upload operation.
- `upload_timeout`: Whenever locally buffered data has been present on the filesystem
  in the `store_dir` longer than the configured `upload_timeout`, it will be sent
  even when the desired byte size hasn't been reached.
  If you configure a small `upload_timeout`, your files may be smaller
  than the `total_file_size`. The timeout is evaluated against the time at which S3
  started buffering data for each unqiue tag (that is, the time when new data was
  buffered for the unique tag after the last upload). The timeout is also evaluated
  against the
  [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)
  time, so a multipart upload will be completed after `upload_timeout` has elapsed,
  even if the desired size has not yet been reached.

If your `upload_timeout` triggers an upload before the pending buffered data reaches
the `upload_chunk_size`, it may be too small for a multipart upload. S3 will
fallback to use the [`PutObject` API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html).

When you enable compression, S3 applies the compression algorithm at send time. The
size settings trigger uploads based on the size of buffered data, not the
final compressed size. It's possible that after compression, buffered data no longer
meets the required minimum S3
[UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)
size. If this occurs, you will see a log message like:

```text
[ info] [output:s3:s3.0] Pre-compression upload_chunk_size= 5630650, After
compression, chunk is only 1063320 bytes, the chunk was too small, using PutObject to upload
```

If you encounter this frequently, use the numbers in the messages to guess your
compression factor. In this example, the buffered data was reduced from
5,630,650 bytes to 1,063,320 bytes. The compressed size is one-fifth the actual data size.
Configuring `upload_chunk_size 30M` should ensure each part is large enough after
compression to be over the minimum required part size of 5,242,880 bytes.

The S3 API allows the last part in an upload to be less than the 5,242,880 byte
minimum. If a part is too small for an existing upload, the S3 output will
upload that part and then complete the upload.

### `upload_timeout` constrains total multipart upload time for a single file

The `upload_timeout` evaluated against the
[CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)
time. A multipart upload will be completed after `upload_timeout` elapses, even if
the desired size has not yet been reached.

### Completing uploads

When
[CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)
is called, an `UploadID` is returned. S3 stores these IDs for active uploads in the
`store_dir`. Until
[CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html)
is called, the uploaded data isn't visible in S3.

On shutdown, S3 output attempts to complete all pending uploads. If an upload fails
to complete, the ID remains buffered in the `store_dir` in a directory called
`multipart_upload_metadata`. If you restart the S3 output with the same `store_dir`
it will discover the old UploadIDs and complete the pending uploads. The [S3
documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/discovering-and-deleting-incomplete-multipart-uploads-to-lower-amazon-s3-costs/)
has suggestions on discovering and deleting or completing dangling uploads in your
buckets.

## Usage with MinIO

[MinIO](https://min.io/) is a high-performance, S3 compatible object storage and you
can build your app with S3 functionality without S3.

The following example runs [a MinIO server](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html)
at `localhost:9000`, and create a bucket of `your-bucket`.

Example:

```python
[OUTPUT]
   Name s3
   Match *
   bucket your-bucket
   endpoint http://localhost:9000
```

The records store in the MinIO server.

## Get Started

To send records into Amazon S3, you can run the plugin from the command line or
through the configuration file.

### Command Line

The S3 plugin reads parameters from the command line through the `-p` argument:

```text
fluent-bit -i cpu -o s3 -p bucket=my-bucket -p region=us-west-2 -p -m '*' -f 1
```

### Configuration File

In your main configuration file append the following `Output` section:

```python
[OUTPUT]
    Name s3
    Match *
    bucket your-bucket
    region us-east-1
    store_dir /home/ec2-user/buffer
    total_file_size 50M
    upload_timeout 10m
```

An example using `PutObject` instead of multipart:

```python
[OUTPUT]
    Name s3
    Match *
    bucket your-bucket
    region us-east-1
    store_dir /home/ec2-user/buffer
    use_put_object On
    total_file_size 10M
    upload_timeout 10m
```

## Advanced usage

### Use Apache Arrow for in-memory data processing

With Fluent Bit v1.8 or greater, the Amazon S3 plugin includes the support for
[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/). Support isn't enabled by
default, and has a dependency on a shared version of `libarrow`.

To use this feature, `FLB_ARROW` must be turned on at compile time. Use the following
commands:

```text
cd build/
cmake -DFLB_ARROW=On ..
cmake --build .
```

After being compiled, Fluent Bit can upload incoming data to S3 in Apache Arrow format.

For example:

```python
[INPUT]
    Name cpu

[OUTPUT]
    Name s3
    Bucket your-bucket-name
    total_file_size 1M
    use_put_object On
    upload_timeout 60s
    Compression arrow
```

Setting `Compression` to `arrow` makes Fluent Bit convert payload into Apache Arrow
format.

Load, analyze, and process stored data using popular data
processing tools such as Python pandas, Apache Spark and Tensorflow.

The following example uses `pyarrow` to analyze the uploaded data:

```text
>>> import pyarrow.feather as feather
>>> import pyarrow.fs as fs
>>>
>>> s3 = fs.S3FileSystem()
>>> file = s3.open_input_file("my-bucket/fluent-bit-logs/cpu.0/2021/04/27/09/36/15-object969o67ZF")
>>> df = feather.read_feather(file)
>>> print(df.head())
