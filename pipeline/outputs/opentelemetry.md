# OpenTelemetry

The OpenTelemetry plugin allows you to take logs, metrics, and traces from Fluent Bit and submit them to an OpenTelemetry HTTP endpoint.

Important Note: At the moment only HTTP endpoints are supported.

| Key                  | Description                                                  | Default   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| host                 | IP address or hostname of the target HTTP Server             | 127.0.0.1 |
| http_user            | Basic Auth Username                                          |           |
| http_passwd          | Basic Auth Password. Requires HTTP_user to be set            |           |
| port                 | TCP port of the target HTTP Server                           | 80        |
| proxy                | Specify an HTTP Proxy. The expected format of this value is `http://HOST:PORT`. Note that HTTPS is **not** currently supported. It is recommended not to set this and to configure the [HTTP proxy environment variables](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/http-proxy) instead as they support both HTTP and HTTPS. |           |
| metrics_uri                  | Specify an optional HTTP URI for the target web server listening for metrics, e.g: /v1/metrics | /         |
| logs_uri                  | Specify an optional HTTP URI for the target web server listening for logs, e.g: /v1/logs | /         |
| traces_uri                  | Specify an optional HTTP URI for the target web server listening for traces, e.g: /v1/traces | /         |
| header               | Add a HTTP header key/value pair. Multiple headers can be set. |           |
| log_response_payload | Log the response payload within the Fluent Bit log           | false     |
| add_label            | This allows you to add custom labels to all metrics exposed through the OpenTelemetry exporter. You may have multiple of these fields |           |

## Getting Started

The OpenTelemetry plugin works with logs and only the metrics collected from one of the metric input plugins. In the following example, log records generated by the dummy plugin and the host metrics collected by the node exporter metrics plugin are exported by the OpenTelemetry output plugin.

```
# Dummy Logs & traces with Node Exporter Metrics export using OpenTelemetry output plugin
# -------------------------------------------
# The following example collects host metrics on Linux and dummy logs & traces and delivers
# them through the OpenTelemetry plugin to a local collector :
