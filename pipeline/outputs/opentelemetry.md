# OpenTelemetry

The OpenTelemetry plugin allows you to take logs, metrics, and traces from Fluent Bit and submit them to an OpenTelemetry HTTP endpoint.

Important Note: At the moment only HTTP endpoints are supported.

| Key                  | Description                                                  | Default   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| host                 | IP address or hostname of the target HTTP Server             | 127.0.0.1 |
| http_user            | Basic Auth Username                                          |           |
| http_passwd          | Basic Auth Password. Requires HTTP_user to be set            |           |
| port                 | TCP port of the target HTTP Server                           | 80        |
| proxy                | Specify an HTTP Proxy. The expected format of this value is `http://HOST:PORT`. Note that HTTPS is **not** currently supported. It is recommended not to set this and to configure the [HTTP proxy environment variables](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/http-proxy) instead as they support both HTTP and HTTPS. |           |
| http2 | Defines whether HTTP/2 protocol is enabled. This setting also supports the `force` option, which forces HTTP/2 over a plaintext connection. | On |
| grpc | Enables gRPC over an HTTP/2 connection. This setting applies to HTTP/2 only. | off |
| metrics_uri                  | Specify an optional HTTP URI for the target web server listening for metrics, e.g: /v1/metrics | /         |
| logs_uri                  | Specify an optional HTTP URI for the target web server listening for logs, e.g: /v1/logs | /         |
| traces_uri                  | Specify an optional HTTP URI for the target web server listening for traces, e.g: /v1/traces | /         |
| header               | Add a HTTP header key/value pair. Multiple headers can be set. |           |
| log_response_payload | Log the response payload within the Fluent Bit log           | false     |
| logs_body_key | The log body key to look up in the log events body/message. Sets the Body field of the opentelemtry logs data model.   | message     |
| logs_trace_id_message_key | The trace id key to look up in the log events body/message. Sets the TraceId field of the opentelemtry logs data model.  | traceId     |
| logs_span_id_message_key | The span id key to look up in the log events body/message. Sets the SpanId field of the opentelemtry logs data model.  | spanId     |
| logs_severity_text_message_key | The severity text id key to look up in the log events body/message. Sets the SeverityText field of the opentelemtry logs data model.  | severityText     |
| logs_severity_number_message_key | The severity number id key to look up in the log events body/message. Sets the SeverityNumber field of the opentelemtry logs data model.  | severityNumber     |
| add_label            | This allows you to add custom labels to all metrics exposed through the OpenTelemetry exporter. You may have multiple of these fields |           |
| compress            | Set payload compression mechanism. Option available is 'gzip' |           |
| logs_observed_timestamp_metadata_key | Specify an ObservedTimestamp key to look up in the metadata. | $ObservedKey |
| logs_timestamp_metadata_key |Specify a Timestamp key to look up in the metadata. | $Timestamp |
| logs_severity_key_metadata_key |Specify a SeverityText key to look up in the metadata.| $SeverityText |
| logs_severity_number_metadata_key | Specify a SeverityNumber key to look up in the metadata.| $SeverityNumber |
| logs_trace_flags_metadata_key |Specify a Flags key to look up in the metadata.| $Flags |
| logs_span_id_metadata_key |Specify a SpanId key to look up in the metadata.| $SpanId |
| logs_trace_id_metadata_key |Specify a TraceId key to look up in the metadata.| $TraceId |
| logs_attributes_metadata_key |Specify an Attributes key to look up in the metadata.| $Attributes |
| workers | The number of [workers](../../administration/multithreading.md#outputs) to perform flush operations for this output. | `0` |

## Getting Started

The OpenTelemetry plugin works with logs and only the metrics collected from one of the metric input plugins. In the following example, log records generated by the dummy plugin and the host metrics collected by the node exporter metrics plugin are exported by the OpenTelemetry output plugin.

```
# Dummy Logs & traces with Node Exporter Metrics export using OpenTelemetry output plugin
# -------------------------------------------
# The following example collects host metrics on Linux and dummy logs & traces and delivers
# them through the OpenTelemetry plugin to a local collector :
