# Labels
The **labels** processor lets you manipulate the labels of metrics.

Similar to filters, this processor presents a enriching/modifying mechanism to
perform operations for labels manipulation. The most significant difference is
that processors perform better than filters, and when chaining them there are no
encoding or decoding performance penalties.

**Note:** Both processors and this specific component can be enabled only by using
the YAML configuration format. Classic mode configuration format doesn't support
processors.

## Configuration Parameters

| Key    | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| update | Update an existing key with a value into metrics. The key/value pair is required. If the specified key doesn't exist, the operation silently fails and has no effect. |
| insert | Insert a new key with a value into metrics. The key/value pair is required. |
| upsert  | Upsert a specific key with a value, the `upsert` operation will try to update the value of the key. If the key does not exist, the key will be created. The key-value pair is required. |
| delete | Delete a key from the labels of metrics. The key/value pair is required. If the specified key doesn't exist, the operation silently fails and has no effect. |
| hash   | Replace the key value with a hash generated by the SHA-256 algorithm from the specified label name. The generated binary value is set as a hex string. |

#### Update example

Change the value of the `name` to `fluentbit`:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="fluent-bit.yaml" %}

```yaml
pipeline:
    inputs:
        - name: fluentbit_metrics
      
          processors:
              metrics:
                  - name: labels
                    update: name fluentbit
    outputs:
        - name : stdout
          match: '*'
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Insert example

The following example appends the key `agent` with the value `fluentbit` as the label
of metrics:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="fluent-bit.yaml" %}

```yaml
pipeline:
    inputs:
        - name: fluentbit_metrics
          
          processors:
              metrics:
                  - name: labels
                    insert: agent fluentbit
  
    outputs:
        - name : stdout
          match: '*'
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Upsert example

Upsert the value of `name` and insert `fluentbit`:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="fluent-bit.yaml" %}

```yaml
pipeline:
    inputs:
        - name: fluentbit_metrics
          
          processors:
              metrics:
                  - name: labels
                    upsert: name fluentbit
    outputs:
        - name : stdout
          match: '*'
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Delete example

Delete containing `name` key from metrics:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="fluent-bit.yaml" %}

```yaml
pipeline:
    inputs:
        - name: fluentbit_metrics
      
          processors:
              metrics:
                  - name: labels
                    delete: name
    outputs:
        - name : stdout
          match: '*'
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Hash example

Apply the SHA-1 algorithm for the value of the key `hostname`:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="fluent-bit.yaml" %}

```yaml
pipeline:
    inputs:
        - name: fluentbit_metrics
          
          processors:
              metrics:
                  - name: labels
                    hash: hostname
    outputs:
        - name : stdout
          match: '*'
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
