# Inputs

Input plugins gather information from different sources. Some plugins collect data from log files, and others gather metrics information from the operating system. There are many different plugins, and they let you handle many different needs.

When an input plugin loads, an internal _instance_ is created. Each instance has its own independent configuration. Configuration keys are often called _properties_.
