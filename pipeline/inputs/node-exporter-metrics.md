description: A plugin based on Prometheus Node Exporter to collect system and host level metrics

# Node exporter metrics

[Prometheus Node exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) is a popular way to collect system level metrics from operating systems, such as CPU, disk, network, and process statistics. Fluent Bit includes a node exporter metrics plugin that builds off the Prometheus design to collect system level metrics without having to manage two separate processes or agents.

The _Node exporter metrics_ plugin contains a subset of collectors and metrics available from Prometheus Node exporter.

{% hint style="info" %}

Metrics collected with Node Exporter Metrics flow through a separate pipeline from logs and current filters don't operate on top of metrics.
This plugin is generally supported on Linux-based operating systems, with macOS offering a reduced subset of metrics.

{% endhint %}

## Configuration

`scrape_interval` sets the default for all scrapes. To set granular scrape intervals, set the specific interval. For example, `collector.cpu.scrape_interval`. When using a granular scrape interval, if a value greater than `0` is used, it overrides the global default. Otherwise, the global default is used.

The plugin top-level `scrape_interval` setting is the global default. Any custom settings for individual `scrape_intervals` override that specific metric scraping interval.

Each `collector.xxx.scrape_interval` option only overrides the interval for that specific collector and updates the associated set of provided metrics.

Overridden intervals only change the collection interval, not the interval for publishing the metrics which is taken from the global setting.

For example, if the global interval is set to `5` and an override interval of `60` is used, the published metrics will be reported every five seconds. However, the specific collector will stay the same for 60 seconds until it's collected again.

This helps with down-sampling when collecting metrics.

## Collectors available

The following table describes the available collectors as part of this plugin. They're enabled by default and respect the original metrics name, descriptions, and types from Prometheus Exporter. You can use your current dashboards without any compatibility problem.

The Version column specifies the Fluent Bit version where the collector is available.

## Get started

### Configuration file

In the following configuration file, the input plugin `node_exporter_metrics` collects metrics every two seconds and exposes them through the [Prometheus Exporter](../outputs/prometheus-exporter.md) output plugin on HTTP/TCP port 2021.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="fluent-bit.yaml" %}

```yaml
# Node Exporter Metrics + Prometheus Exporter
# -------------------------------------------
# The following example collect host metrics on Linux and expose
# them through a Prometheus HTTP end-point.
#
# After starting the service try it with:
#
# $ curl http://127.0.0.1:2021/metrics
#
service:
  flush: 1
  log_level: info

pipeline:
  inputs:
    - name: node_exporter_metrics
      tag:  node_metrics
      scrape_interval: 2

  outputs:
    - name: prometheus_exporter
      match: node_metrics
      host: 0.0.0.0
      port: 2021
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab title="fluent-bit.conf" %}

```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

You can test the expose of the metrics by using `curl`:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:2021/metrics
```

### Container to collect host metrics

When deploying Fluent Bit in a container you will need to specify additional settings to ensure that Fluent Bit has access to the host operating system. The following Docker command deploys Fluent Bit with specific mount paths and settings enabled to ensure that Fluent Bit can collect from the host. These are then exposed over port `2021`.

```shell
docker run -ti -v /proc:/host/proc \
           -v /sys:/host/sys   \
           -p 2021:2021        \
           fluent/fluent-bit:1.8.0 \
           /fluent-bit/bin/fluent-bit \
           -i node_exporter_metrics \
           -p path.procfs=/host/proc \
           -p path.sysfs=/host/sys \
           -o prometheus_exporter \
           -p "add_label=host $HOSTNAME" \
           -f 1
```

### Fluent Bit with Prometheus and Grafana

If you use dashboards for monitoring, Grafana is one option. The Fluent Bit source code repository contains a `docker-compose` example.

1. Download the Fluent Bit source code:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit

   cd fluent-bit/docker_compose/node-exporter-dashboard/
   ```

2. Start the service and view your dashboard:

   ```shell
   docker-compose up --force-recreate -d --build
   ```

3. Open your browser and use the address `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

4. When asked for the credentials to access Grafana, use `admin` for the username and
   password. See [Sign in to Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/sign-in-to-grafana/).

![An example Grafana dashboard](../../.gitbook/assets/updated.png)

By default, Grafana dashboard plots the data from the last 24 hours. Change it to **Last 5 minutes** to see the recent data being collected.

#### Stop the Service

```shell
docker-compose down
```

## Enhancement requests

The plugin implements a subset of the available collectors in the original Prometheus Node exporter. If you would like a specific collector prioritized, open a GitHub issue by using the following template:
