# Windows Exporter Metrics

[Prometheus Windows Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter) is a popular way to collect system level metrics from microsoft windows, such as CPU / Disk / Network / Process statistics. Fluent Bit 1.9.0 includes windows exporter metrics plugin that builds off the Prometheus design to collect system level metrics without having to manage two separate processes or agents.

The initial release of Windows Exporter Metrics contains a single collector available from Prometheus Windows Exporter and we plan to expand it over time.

**Important note:** Metrics collected with Windows Exporter Metrics flow through a separate pipeline from logs and current filters do not operate on top of metrics.

## Getting Started

### Simple Configuration File

In the following configuration file, the input plugin _windows_exporter_metrics collects _metrics every 2 seconds and exposes them through our [Prometheus Exporter](../outputs/prometheus-exporter.md) output plugin on HTTP/TCP port 2021.

```
# Node Exporter Metrics + Prometheus Exporter
# -------------------------------------------
# The following example collect host metrics on Linux and expose
# them through a Prometheus HTTP end-point.
#
# After starting the service try it with:
#
# $ curl http://127.0.0.1:2021/metrics
#
[SERVICE]
    flush           1
    log_level       info

[INPUT]
    name            windows_exporter_metrics
    tag             node_metrics
    scrape_interval 2

[OUTPUT]
    name            prometheus_exporter
    match           node_metrics
    host            0.0.0.0
    port            2021


```

You can test the expose of the metrics by using _curl:_

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:2021/metrics
```

### Service where clause

Windows service collector will retrieve all of the service information for the local node or container.
`we.service.where`, `we.service.include`, and `we.service.exclude` can be used to filter the service metrics.

To filter these metrics, users should specify a WHERE clause.
This syntax is defined in [the WMI Query Language(WQL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wql-sql-for-wmi).

Here is how these parameters should work:

#### we.service.where

`we.service.where` is handled as a raw WHERE clause.
For example, when a user specifies the parameter as follows:

```
we.service.where Status!='OK'
```

This creates a WMI query like so:
```
SELECT * FROM Win32_Service WHERE Status!='OK'
```

The WMI mechanism will then handle it and return the information which has a "not OK" status in this example.

### we.service.include

When defined, the `we.service.include` is interpreted into a WHERE clause.
If multiple key-value pairs are specified, the values will be concatenated with `OR`.
Also, if the values contain `%` character then a `LIKE` operator will be used in the clause instead of the `=` operator.
When a user specifies the parameter as follows:

```python
we.service.include {"Name":"docker","Name":"%Svc%", "Name":"%Service"}
```

The parameter will be interpreted as:
```
(Name='docker' OR Name LIKE '%Svc%' OR Name LIKE '%Service')
```

The WMI query will be called with the translated parameter as:

```
SELECT * FROM Win32_Service WHERE (Name='docker' OR Name LIKE '%Svc%' OR Name LIKE '%Service')
```

### we.service.exclude

When defined, the `we.service.exclude` is interpreted into a WHERE clause.
If multiple key-value pairs are specified, the values will be concatenated with `AND`.

Also, if the values contain `%` character then a `LIKE` operator will be used in the translated clause instead of the `!=` operator.
When a user specifies the parameter as follows:

```python
we.service.exclude {"Name":"UdkUserSvc%","Name":"webthreatdefusersvc%","Name":"XboxNetApiSvc"}
```

The parameter will be interpreted as:
```
(NOT Name LIKE 'UdkUserSvc%' AND NOT Name LIKE 'webthreatdefusersvc%' AND Name!='XboxNetApiSvc')
```

The WMI query will be called with the translated parameter as:

```
SELECT * FROM Win32_Service WHERE (NOT Name LIKE 'UdkUserSvc%' AND NOT Name LIKE 'webthreatdefusersvc%' AND Name!='XboxNetApiSvc')
```

### Advanced usage

`we.service.where`, `we.service.include`, and `we.service.exclude` can all be used at the same time subject to the following rules.

1. `we.service.include` translated and applied into the where clause in the service collector
1. `we.service.exclude` translated and applied into the where clause in the service collector
    1. If the `we.service.include` is applied, translated `we.service.include` and `we.service.exclude` conditions are concatenated with `AND`.
1. `we.service.where` is just handled as-is into the where clause in the service collector .
    1. If either of the above parameters is applied, the clause will be applied with `AND (` _the value of `we.service.where`_ `)`.

For example, when a user specifies the parameter as follows:

```
we.service.include {"Name":"docker","Name":"%Svc%", "Name":"%Service"}
we.service.exclude {"Name":"UdkUserSvc%","Name":"XboxNetApiSvc"}
we.service.where NOT Name LIKE 'webthreatdefusersvc%'
```

The WMI query will be called with the translated parameter as:

```
 SELECT * FROM Win32_Service WHERE (Name='docker' OR Name LIKE '%Svc%' OR Name LIKE '%Service') AND (NOT Name LIKE 'UdkUserSvc%' AND Name!='XboxNetApiSvc') AND (NOT Name LIKE 'webthreatdefusersvc%')
```
