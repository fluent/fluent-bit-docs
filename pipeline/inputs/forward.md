# Forward

_Forward_ is the protocol used by [Fluent Bit](http://fluentbit.io) and [Fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org) to route messages between peers. This plugin implements the input service to listen for Forward messages.

## Configuration Parameters

The plugin supports the following configuration parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Listen | Listener network interface. | 0.0.0.0 |
| Port | TCP port to listen for incoming connections. | 24224 |
| Buffer\_Max\_Size | Specify the maximum buffer memory size used to receive a Forward message. The value must be according to the [Unit Size](../administration/configuring-fluent-bit/unit-sizes.md) specification. | _Buffer\_Chunk\_Size_ |
| Buffer\_Chunk\_Size | By default the buffer to store the incoming Forward messages, do not allocate the maximum memory allowed, instead it allocate memory when is required. The rounds of allocations are set by _Buffer\_Chunk\_Size_. The value must be according to the [Unit Size](../administration/configuring-fluent-bit/unit-sizes.md) specification. | 32KB |

## Getting Started

In order to receive Forward messages, you can run the plugin from the command line or through the configuration file:

### Command Line

From the command line you can let Fluent Bit listen for _Forward_ messages with the following options:

```bash
$ fluent-bit -i forward -o stdout
```

By default the service will listen an all interfaces \(0.0.0.0\) through TCP port 24224, optionally you can change this directly, e.g:

```bash
$ fluent-bit -i forward://192.168.3.2:9090 -o stdout
```

In the example the Forward messages will only arrive through network interface under 192.168.3.2 address and TCP Port 9090.

### Configuration File

In your main configuration file append the following _Input_ & _Output_ sections:

```python
[INPUT]
    Name              forward
    Listen            0.0.0.0
    Port              24224
    Buffer_Chunk_Size 32KB
    Buffer_Max_Size   64KB

[OUTPUT]
    Name   stdout
    Match  *
```

## Testing

Once Fluent Bit is running, you can send some messages using the _fluent-cat_ tool \(this tool is provided by [Fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org):

```bash
$ echo '{"key 1": 123456789, "key 2": "abcdefg"}' | fluent-cat my_tag
```

In [Fluent Bit](http://fluentbit.io) we should see the following output:

```bash
$ bin/fluent-bit -i forward -o stdout
Fluent-Bit v0.9.0
