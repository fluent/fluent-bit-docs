- [Grafana Dashboards and Alerts](../administration/monitoring.md#grafana-dashboard-and-alerts)
- [Health Checks](../administration/monitoring.md#health-check-for-fluent-bit)
- [Telemetry Pipeline: hosted service to monitor and visualize your pipelines](../administration/monitoring.md#telemetry-pipeline)
