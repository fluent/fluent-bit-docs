# Pipeline Monitoring

A Data Pipeline represents a flow of data that goes through the inputs \(sources\), filers, and output \(sinks\). There are a couple of ways to monitor the pipeline. We recommend the following sections for a better understanding and steps to get started:

* [HTTP Server: JSON and Prometheus Exporter-style metrics](../administration/monitoring.md#http-server)
* [Grafana Dashboards and Alerts](../administration/monitoring.md#grafana-dashboard-and-alerts)
* [Health Checks](../administration/monitoring.md#health-check-for-fluent-bit)
* [Calyptia Cloud: hosted service to monitor and visualize your pipelines](../administration/monitoring.md#calyptia-cloud)
