# Configuration

Fluent Bit is flexible enough to be configured either from the command line or through a configuration file. For production environments, we strongly recommends to use the configuration file approach.

Note that all configuration files uses a specific fixed and strict schema, please proceed to the following sections for a better understanding:

* [File Schema](schema.md) \(must read\)
* [Configuration Files](file.md)
* [Configuration Variables](variables.md)
* [Configuration Commands](commands.md)
* [Unit Sizes](unit_sizes.md)
* [TLS / SSL](tls_ssl.md)
* [Backpressure](backpressure.md)
* [Memory Usage](memory_usage.md)
