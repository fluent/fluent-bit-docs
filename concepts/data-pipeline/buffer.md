# Buffer

Previously defined in the [Buffering](../buffering.md) concept section, the `buffer` phase in the pipeline aims to provide a unified and persistent mechanism to store your data, either using the primary in-memory model or using the filesystem based mode.

The `buffer` phase already contains the data in an immutable state, meaning, no other filter can be applied.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that buffered data is not raw text, it's in Fluent Bit's internal binary representation.
{% endhint %}

Fluent Bit offers a buffering mechanism in the file system that acts as a _backup system_ to avoid data loss in case of system failures.
