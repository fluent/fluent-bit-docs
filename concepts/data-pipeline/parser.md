description: Convert unstructured messages to structured messages

# Parser

Dealing with raw strings or unstructured messages is difficult. Having a structure
makes data more usable. Set a structure to the incoming data by using input
plugins as data is collected:

```mermaid
graph LR
    accTitle: Fluent Bit data pipeline
    accDescr: A diagram of the Fluent Bit data pipeline, which includes input, a parser, a filter, a buffer, routing, and various outputs.
    A[Input] --> B[Parser]
    B --> C[Filter]
    C --> D[Buffer]
    D --> E((Routing))
    E --> F[Output 1]
    E --> G[Output 2]
    E --> H[Output 3]
    style B stroke:darkred,stroke-width:2px;
```

The parser converts unstructured data to structured data. As an example, consider the
following Apache (HTTP Server) log entry:

```text
192.168.2.20 - - [28/Jul/2006:10:27:10 -0300] "GET /cgi-bin/try/ HTTP/1.0" 200 3395
```

This log line is a raw string without format. Structuring the log makes it easier
to process the data later. If the
[regular expression parser](pipeline/parsers/regular-expression) is used, the log
entry could be converted to:

```javascript
{
  "host":    "192.168.2.20",
  "user":    "-",
  "method":  "GET",
  "path":    "/cgi-bin/try/",
  "code":    "200",
  "size":    "3395",
  "referer": "",
  "agent":   ""
 }
```

Parsers are fully configurable and are independently and optionally handled by each
input plugin. For more details, see
[Parsers](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/parsers).
