# Buffering

When [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io) processes data, it uses the system memory
(heap) as a primary and temporary place to store the record logs before they get
delivered. The records are processed in this private memory area.

Buffering is the ability to store the records, and continue storing incoming data
while previous data is processed and delivered. Buffering in memory is the fastest
mechanism, but there are scenarios requiring special strategies to deal with
[backpressure](../administration/backpressure.md), data safety, or to reduce memory
consumption by the service in constrained environments.

Network failures or latency in third party service is common. When data can't be
delivered fast enough and new data to process arrives, the system can face
backpressure.

Fluent Bit buffering strategies are designed to solve problems associated with
backpressure and general delivery failures. Fluent Bit offers a primary buffering
mechanism in memory and an optional secondary one using the file system. With
this hybrid solution you can accommodate any use case safely and keep a high
performance while processing your data.

These mechanisms aren't mutually exclusive. When data is ready to be processed or
delivered it's always be in memory, while other data in the queue might be in
the file system until is ready to be processed and moved up to memory.

To learn more about the buffering configuration in Fluent Bit, see
[Buffering & Storage](../administration/buffering-and-storage.md).
