# Kubernetes

The _Kubernetes Filter_ allows to enrich your log files with Kubernetes metadata.

When Fluent Bit is deployed in Kubernetes as a DaemonSet and configured to read the log files from the containers \(using tail plugin\), this filter aims to perform the following operations:

* Analyze the Tag and extract the following metadata:
  * POD Name
  * Namespace
  * Container Name
  * Container ID
* Query Kubernetes API Server to obtain extra metadata for the POD in question:
  * POD ID
  * Labels
  * Annotations

The data is cached locally in memory and appended to each record.

## Configuration Parameters

The plugin supports the following configuration parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Buffer\_Size | Set the buffer size for HTTP client when reading responses from Kubernetes API server. The value must be according to the [Unit Size](../configuration/unit_sizes.md) specification. | 32k |
| Kube\_URL       | API Server end-point  | https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local:443 |
| Kube\_CA\_File | CA certificate file   | /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt|
| Kube\_CA\_Path | Absolute path to scan for certificate files |  |
| Kube\_Token\_File | Token file | /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token |
| Merge\_Log | When enabled, it checks if the `log` field content is a JSON string map, if so, it append the map fields as part of the log structure. | Off |
| Merge\_Log\_Key | When `Merge_Log` is enabled, the filter tries to assume the `log` field from the incoming message is a JSON string message and make a structured representation of it at the same level of the `log` field in the map. Now if `Merge_Log_Key` is set \(a string name\), all the new structured fields taken from the original `log` content are inserted under the new key. |  |
| tls.debug | Debug level between 0 \(nothing\) and 4 \(every detail\). | -1 |
| tls.verify | When enabled, turns on certificate validation when connecting to the Kubernetes API server. | On |
| Use\_Journal | When enabled, the filter reads logs coming in Journald format. | Off |
| Regex\_Parser | Set an alternative Parser to process record Tag and extract pod\_name, namespace\_name, container\_name and docker\_id. The parser must be registered in a [parsers file](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/blob/master/conf/parsers.conf) \(refer to parser _filter-kube-test_ as an example\). |  |
| K8S-Logging.Parser | Allow Kubernetes Pods to  suggest a pre-defined Parser (read more about it in Kubernetes Annotations section) | Off |
| K8S-Logging.Exclude | Allow Kubernetes Pods to exclude their logs from the log processor (read more about it in Kubernetes Annotations section). | Off |



## Kubernetes Annotations

A flexible feature of Fluent Bit Kubernetes filter is that allow Kubernetes Pods to suggest certain behaviors for the log processor pipeline when processing the records. At the moment it support:

- Suggest a pre-defined parser
- Request to exclude logs

The following annotations are available:

| Annotation                       | Description                                                  | Default |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| fluentbit.io/parser[_stream][-container]  | Suggest a pre-defined parser. The parser must be registered already by Fluent Bit. This option will only be processed if Fluent Bit configuration (Kubernetes Filter) have enabled the option _K8S-Logging.Parser_. If present, the stream (stdout or stderr) will restrict that tspecific stream. If present, the container can override a specific container in a Pod. |         |
| fluentbit.io/exclude             | Request to Fluent Bit to exclude or not the logs generated by the Pod.  This option will only be processed if Fluent Bit configuration  (Kubernetes Filter) have enabled the option _K8S-Logging.Exclude_. | False   |

### Annotation Examples in Pod definition

#### Suggest a parser

The following Pod definition runs a Pod that emits Apache logs to the standard output, in the Annotations it suggest that the data should be processed using the pre-defined parser called _apache_: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: apache-logs
  labels:
    app: apache-logs
  annotations:
    fluentbit.io/parser: apache
spec:
  containers:
  - name: apache
    image: edsiper/apache_logs
```

#### Request to exclude logs

There are certain situations where the user would like to request that the log processor simply skip the logs from the Pod in question:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: apache-logs
  labels:
    app: apache-logs
  annotations:
    fluentbit.io/exclude: "true"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: apache
    image: edsiper/apache_logs
```

Note that the annotation value is boolean which can take a _true_ or _false_ and __must__ be quoted.
