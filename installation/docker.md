It is strongly suggested that you always use the latest image of Fluent Bit.

## Multi Architecture Images

Our production stable images are based on [Distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) focusing on security containing just the Fluent Bit binary and minimal system libraries and basic configuration. 
We also provide **debug** images for all architectures (from 1.9.0+) which contain a full (Debian) shell and package manager that can be used to troubleshoot or for testing purposes.

From a deployment perspective, there is no need to specify an architecture, the container client tool that pulls the image gets the proper layer for the running architecture.

## Getting Started

Download the last stable image from 2.0 series:

```shell
docker pull cr.fluentbit.io/fluent/fluent-bit:2.0
```

Once the image is in place, now run the following (useless) test which makes Fluent Bit measure CPU usage by the container:

```shell
docker run -ti cr.fluentbit.io/fluent/fluent-bit:2.0 \
  -i cpu -o stdout -f 1
```

That command will let Fluent Bit measure CPU usage every second and flush the results to the standard output, e.g:

```shell
[2019/10/01 12:29:02] [ info] [engine] started
[0] cpu.0: [1504290543.000487750, {"cpu_p"=>0.750000, "user_p"=>0.250000, "system_p"=>0.500000, "cpu0.p_cpu"=>0.000000, "cpu0.p_user"=>0.000000, "cpu0.p_system"=>0.000000, "cpu1.p_cpu"=>1.000000, "cpu1.p_user"=>0.000000, "cpu1.p_system"=>1.000000, "cpu2.p_cpu"=>1.000000, "cpu2.p_user"=>1.000000, "cpu2.p_system"=>0.000000, "cpu3.p_cpu"=>0.000000, "cpu3.p_user"=>0.000000, "cpu3.p_system"=>0.000000}]
```

## F.A.Q

### Why there is no Fluent Bit Docker image based on Alpine Linux ?

Alpine Linux uses Musl C library instead of Glibc. Musl is not fully compatible with Glibc which generated many issues in the following areas when used with Fluent Bit:

* Memory Allocator: to run Fluent Bit properly in high-load environments, we use Jemalloc as a default memory allocator which reduce fragmentation and provides better performance for our needs. Jemalloc cannot run smoothly with Musl and requires extra work.
* Alpine Linux Musl functions bootstrap have a compatibility issue when loading Golang shared libraries, this generate problems when trying to load Golang output plugins in Fluent Bit.
* Alpine Linux Musl Time format parser does not support Glibc extensions
* Maintainers preference in terms of base image due to security and maintenance reasons are Distroless and Debian.
