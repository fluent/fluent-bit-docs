From an architecture support perspective, Fluent Bit is fully functional on x86_64, Arm64v8, and Arm32v7 based processors.

Fluent Bit can work also on macOS and Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) systems, but not all plugins will be available on all platforms.

Official support is based on community demand. Fluent Bit might run on older operating systems, but must be built from source, or using custom packages from [enterprise providers](https://fluentbit.io/enterprise).

Fluent Bit is supported for Linux on IBM Z (s390x) environments with some restrictions, but only container images are provided for these targets officially.
