# Upgrade Notes

The following article covers the relevant compatibility changes for users upgrading
from previous Fluent Bit versions.

For more details about changes on each release, refer to the
[Official Release Notes](https://fluentbit.io/announcements/).

Release notes will be prepared in advance of a Git tag for a release. An official
release should provide both a tag and a release note together to allow users to
verify and understand the release contents.

The tag drives the binary release process. Release binaries (containers and packages)
will appear after a tag and its associated release note. This lets users to expect
the new release binary to appear and allow/deny/update it as appropriate in their
infrastructure.

## Fluent Bit v3.2.8

Apt repos have their `Origin` and `Label` set to`packages.fluentbit.io` and `fluent-bit` respectively.
This was done via <https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/pull/9949>.
Previously both values were set to `. <CODENAME>`, e.g. `. Jammy`.

For existing repos, doing an `apt-get` update will flag this change so the settings may need updating:

```shell
Repository 'https://packages.fluentbit.io/ubuntu/jammy jammy InRelease' changed its 'Origin' value from '. jammy' to 'packages.fluentbit.io'
Repository 'https://packages.fluentbit.io/ubuntu/jammy jammy InRelease' changed its 'Label' value from '. jammy' to 'fluent-bit'
```

You may need to allow the updated information to be added, e.g. via `sudo apt-get update --allow-releaseinfo-change` or by modifying the repository configuration directly.

## Fluent Bit v1.9.9

The `td-agent-bit` package is no longer provided after this release.
Users should switch to the `fluent-bit` package.

## Fluent Bit v1.6

If you are migrating from previous version of Fluent Bit, review the following
important changes:

### Tail Input Plugin

By default, the tail input plugin follows a file from the end after the service starts,
instead of reading it from the beginning. Every file found when the plugin starts is
followed from it last position. New files discovered at runtime or when files rotate
are read from the beginning.

To keep the old behavior, set the option `read_from_head` to `true`.

### Stackdriver Output Plugin

The `project_id` of
[resource](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/MonitoredResource)
in [LogEntry](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry)
sent to Google Cloud Logging would be set to the `project_id` rather than the project
number. To learn the difference between Project ID and project number, see
[Creating and managing projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#before_you_begin).

If you have existing queries based on the resource's `project_id,` update your query accordingly.

## Fluent Bit v1.5

The migration from v1.4 to v1.5 is pretty straightforward.

- The `keepalive` configuration mode has been renamed to `net.keepalive`. Now,
  all Network I/O keepalive is enabled by default. To learn more about this and other
  associated configuration properties read the
  [Networking Administration](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/networking#tcp-keepalive)
  section.
- If you use the Elasticsearch output plugin, the default value of `type`
  [changed from `flb_type` to `_doc`](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/commit/04ed3d8104ca8a2f491453777ae6e38e5377817e#diff-c9ae115d3acaceac5efb949edbb21196).
  Many versions of Elasticsearch tolerate this, but Elasticsearch v5.6 through v6.1
  require a `type` without a leading underscore. See the
  [Elasticsearch output plugin documentation FAQ entry](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/elasticsearch#faq-underscore) for more.

## Fluent Bit v1.4

If you are migrating from Fluent Bit v1.3, there are no breaking changes.

## Fluent Bit v1.3

If you are migrating from Fluent Bit v1.2 to v1.3, there are no breaking changes.
If you are upgrading from an older version, review the following incremental changes:

## Fluent Bit v1.2

### Docker, JSON, Parsers and Decoders

Fluent Bit v1.2 fixed many issues associated with JSON encoding and decoding.

For example, when parsing Docker logs, it's no longer necessary to use decoders. The
new Docker parser looks like this:

```python
[PARSER]
    Name         docker
    Format       json
    Time_Key     time
    Time_Format  %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%L
    Time_Keep    On
```

### Kubernetes Filter

Fluent Bit made improvements to Kubernetes Filter handling of stringified `log`
messages. If the `Merge_Log` option is enabled, it will try to handle the log content
as a JSON map, if so, it will add the keys to the root map.

In addition, fixes and improvements were made to the  `Merge_Log_Key` option. If a
merge log succeed, all new keys will be packaged under the key specified by this
option. A suggested configuration is as follows:

```python
[FILTER]
    Name             Kubernetes
    Match            kube.*
    Kube_Tag_Prefix  kube.var.log.containers.
    Merge_Log        On
    Merge_Log_Key    log_processed
```

As an example, if the original log content is the following map:

```javascript
{"key1": "val1", "key2": "val2"}
```

the final record will be composed as follows:

```javascript
{
    "log": "{\"key1\": \"val1\", \"key2\": \"val2\"}",
    "log_processed": {
        "key1": "val1",
        "key2": "val2"
    }
}
```

## Fluent Bit v1.1

If you are upgrading from Fluent Bit 1.0.x or earlier, review the following relevant
changes when switching to Fluent Bit v1.1 or later series:

### Kubernetes filter

Fluent Bit introduced a new configuration property called `Kube_Tag_Prefix` to help
Tag prefix resolution and address an unexpected behavior in previous versions.

During the `1.0.x` release cycle, a commit in the Tail input plugin changed the
default behavior on how the Tag was composed when using the wildcard for expansion
generating breaking compatibility with other services. Consider the following
configuration example:

```python
[INPUT]
    Name  tail
    Path  /var/log/containers/*.log
    Tag   kube.*
```

The expected behavior is that Tag will be expanded to:

```text
kube.var.log.containers.apache.log
```

The change introduced in the 1.0 series switched from absolute path to the base
filename only:

```text
kube.apache.log
```

THe Fluent Bit v1.1 release restored the default behavior and now the Tag is
composed using the absolute path of the monitored file.

Having absolute path in the Tag is relevant for routing and flexible configuration
where it also helps to keep compatibility with Fluentd behavior.

This behavior switch in Tail input plugin affects how Filter Kubernetes operates.
When the filter is used it needs to perform local metadata lookup that comes from the
file names when using Tail as a source. With the new `Kube_Tag_Prefix` option
you can specify the prefix used in the Tail input plugin. For the previous configuration
example the new configuration will look like:

```python
[INPUT]
    Name  tail
    Path  /var/log/containers/*.log
    Tag   kube.*

[FILTER]
    Name             kubernetes
    Match            *
    Kube_Tag_Prefix  kube.var.log.containers.
```

The proper value for `Kube_Tag_Prefix` must be composed by Tag prefix set in Tail
input plugin plus the converted monitored directory replacing slashes with dots.
