# Download Source Code

## Stable

For production systems, we strongly suggest that you always get the latest stable release from our web site, you can get the official tarballs \(.tar.gz\) from the following link:

[https://fluentbit.io/download/](https://fluentbit.io/download/)

## Development

For people who aims to contribute to the project testing or extending the code base, can get the development version from our GIT repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit
```

Note that our _master_ branch is where the development of Fluent Bit happens. Since it's a development version, expect issues when compiling or at run time.

We encourage everybody to help us testing every development version, at the end this is what will become stable.
