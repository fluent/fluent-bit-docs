# Download Source Code

## Stable

For production systems, we strongly suggest that you always get the latest stable release from our website.
The official tarballs \(.tar.gz\) are available using the following link pattern:

https://fluentbit.io/release/1.8/fluent-bit-&lt;release version&gt;.

For version 1.8.11 the link is the following: [https://fluentbit.io/releases/1.8/fluent-bit-1.8.11.tar.gz](https://fluentbit.io/releases/1.8/fluent-bit-1.8.11.tar.gz)

You can also get an archive of the source code in either zip or tarball format from Github using the following link pattern:

https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/archive/refs/tags/v&lt;release version&gt.tar.gz
https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/archive/refs/tags/v&lt;release version&gt.zip

For example for version 1.8.11 the link is the following: [https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/archive/refs/tags/v1.8.11.tar.gz](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/archive/refs/tags/v1.8.11.tar.gz)

## Development

For people who aims to contribute to the project testing or extending the code base, can get the development version from our GIT repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit
```

Note that our _master_ branch is where the development of Fluent Bit happens. Since it's a development version, expect issues when compiling or at run time.

We encourage everybody to help us testing every development version, at the end this is what will become stable.
