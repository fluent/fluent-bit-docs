# Download source code

You can download the most recent stable or development source code.

## Stable

For production systems, it's strongly suggested that you get the latest stable release
of the source code in either zip file or tarball file format from GitHub using the
following link pattern:

```text
https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/archive/refs/tags/v&lt;release version&gt;.tar.gz
https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/archive/refs/tags/v&lt;release version&gt;.zip
```

For example, for version 1.8.12 the link is: [https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/archive/refs/tags/v1.8.12.tar.gz](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/archive/refs/tags/v1.8.12.tar.gz)

## Development

If you want to contribute to Fluent Bit, you should use the most recent code. You can
get the development version from the Git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit
```

The `master` branch is where the development of Fluent Bit happens.
Development version users should expect issues when compiling or at run time.

Fluent Bit users are encouraged to help test every development version to ensure a
stable release.
