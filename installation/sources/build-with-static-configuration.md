# Build with static configuration

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io) in normal operation mode is configurable through
[text files](/installation/configuration/file.md)
or using specific arguments in the command line. Although this is the ideal deployment
case, there are scenarios where a more restricted configuration is required. Static
configuration mode restricts configuration ability.

Static configuration mode includes a built-in configuration in the final binary of
Fluent Bit, disabling the usage of external files or flags at runtime.

## Get started

### Requirements

The following steps assume you are familiar with configuring Fluent Bit using text
files and you have experience building it from scratch as described in
[Build and Install](build-and-install.md).

#### Configuration Directory

In your file system, prepare a specific directory that will be used as an entry
point for the build system to lookup and parse the configuration files. This
directory must contain a minimum of one configuration file called
`fluent-bit.conf` containing the required
[SERVICE](/administration/configuring-fluent-bit/yaml/service-section.md),
[INPUT](/concepts/data-pipeline/input.md), and [OUTPUT](/concepts/data-pipeline/output.md)
sections.

As an example, create a new `fluent-bit.conf` file with the following
content:

```python copy
[SERVICE]
    Flush     1
    Daemon    off
    Log_Level info

[INPUT]
    Name      cpu

[OUTPUT]
    Name      stdout
    Match     *
```

This configuration calculates CPU metrics from the running system and prints them
to the standard output interface.

#### Build with custom configuration

1. Go to the Fluent Bit source code build directory:

   ```bash copy
   cd fluent-bit/build/
   ```

1. Run CMake, appending the `FLB_STATIC_CONF` option pointing to
   the configuration directory recently created:

   ```bash copy
   cmake -DFLB_STATIC_CONF=/path/to/my/confdir/
   ```

1. Build Fluent Bit:

   ```bash copy
   make
   ```

The generated `fluent-bit` binary is ready to run without additional configuration:

```bash
$ bin/fluent-bit
Fluent-Bit v0.15.0
