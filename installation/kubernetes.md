# Fluent Bit on Kubernetes

[Fluent Bit](http://fluentbit.io) is a lightweight and extensible __Log Processor__ that comes with full support for Kubernetes:

- Read Kubernetes/Docker log files from the file system or through Systemd Journal.
- Enrich logs with Kubernetes metadata.
- Deliver logs to third party storage services like Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, HTTP, etc.

## Concepts {#concepts}

Before to get started is important to understand how Fluent Bit will be deployed. Kubernetes manage a cluster of _nodes_, so our log agent tool will need to run on every node to collect logs from every _POD_, for hence Fluent Bit is deployed as a DaemonSet (a POD that runs on every _node_ of the cluster).

When Fluent Bit runs, it will read, parse and filter the logs of every POD and will enrich each entry with the following information (metadata):

- POD Name
- POD ID
- Container Name
- Container ID
- Labels
- Annotations

To obtain these information, a built-in filter plugin called _kubernetes_ talks to the Kubernetes API Server to retrieve relevant information such as the _pod\_id_, _labels_ and _annotations_, other fields such as _pod\_name_, _container\_id_ and _container\_name_ are retrieved locally from the log file names. All of this is handled automatically, no intervention is required from a configuration aspect.

> Our Kubernetes Filter plugin is fully inspired on the [Fluentd Kubernetes Metadata Filter](https://github.com/fabric8io/fluent-plugin-kubernetes_metadata_filter) written by [Jimmi Dyson](https://github.com/jimmidyson).

## Installation {#installation}

[Fluent Bit](http://fluentbit.io) must be deployed as a DaemonSet, so on that way it will be available on every node of your Kubernetes cluster. To get started run the following commands to create the namespace, service account and role setup:

```
$ kubectl create namespace logging
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/master/fluent-bit-service-account.yaml
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/master/fluent-bit-role.yaml
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/master/fluent-bit-role-binding.yaml
```

The next step is to create a ConfigMap that will be used by our Fluent Bit DaemonSet:

```
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/blob/master/output/elasticsearch/fluent-bit-configmap.yaml
```

#### Fluent Bit to Elasticsearch

Fluent Bit DaemonSet ready to be used with Elasticsearch on a normal Kubernetes Cluster:

```
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/blob/master/output/elasticsearch/fluent-bit-ds.yaml
```

#### Fluent Bit to Elasticsearch on Minikube

If you are using Minikube for testing purposes, use the following alternative DaemonSet manifest:

```
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/blob/master/output/elasticsearch/fluent-bit-ds-minikube.yaml
```

## Details

The default configuration of Fluent Bit makes sure of the following:

- Consume all containers logs from the running Node.
- The [Tail input plugin](http://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.12/input/tail.html) will not append more than __5MB__  into the engine until they are flushed to the Elasticsearch backend. This limit aims to provide a workaround for [backpressure](http://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.12/configuration/backpressure.html) scenarios.
- The Kubernetes filter will enrich the logs with Kubernetes metadata, specifically _labels_ and _annotations_. The filter only goes to the API Server when it cannot find the cached info, otherwise it uses the cache.
- The default backend in the configuration is Elasticsearch set by the [Elasticsearch Ouput Plugin](http://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.11/output/elasticsearch.html). It uses the Logstash format to ingest the logs. If you need a different Index and Type, please refer to the plugin option and do your own adjustments.
- There is an option called __Retry_Limit__ set to False, that means if Fluent Bit cannot flush the records to Elasticsearch it will re-try indefinitely until it succeed.
