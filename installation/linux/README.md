# Linux packages

The most secure option is to create the repositories according to the instructions
for your specific OS.

An installation script is provided for use with most Linux targets.
This will by default install the most recent version released.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit/master/install.sh | sh
```

This is a helper and should always be validated prior to use.

## GPG key updates

For the 1.9.0 and 1.8.15 releases and later, the GPG key
[has been updated](https://packages.fluentbit.io/fluentbit.key). Ensure the new
key is added.

The GPG Key fingerprint of the new key is:

```text
C3C0 A285 34B9 293E AF51  FABD 9F9D DC08 3888 C1CD
Fluentbit releases (Releases signing key) <releases@fluentbit.io>
```

The previous key is [still available](https://packages.fluentbit.io/fluentbit-legacy.key)
and might be required to install previous versions.

The GPG Key fingerprint of the old key is:

```text
F209 D876 2A60 CD49 E680 633B 4FF8 368B 6EA0 722A
```

Refer to the [supported platform documentation](./../supported-platforms.md) to see
which platforms are supported in each release.

## Migration to Fluent Bit

For version 1.9 and later, `td-agent-bit` is a deprecated package and is removed
after 1.9.9. The correct package name to use now is `fluent-bit`.
