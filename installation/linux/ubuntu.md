# Ubuntu

Fluent Bit is distributed as **fluent-bit** package and is available for the latest stable Ubuntu system: Focal Fossa.

## Server GPG key

The first step is to add our server GPG key to your keyring to ensure you can get our signed packages.
Follow the official Debian wiki guidance: https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/UseThirdParty#OpenPGP_Key_distribution

```bash
curl https://packages.fluentbit.io/fluentbit.key | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/fluentbit-keyring.gpg
```

## Update your sources lists

On Debian, you need to add our APT server entry to your sources lists, please add the following content at bottom of your **/etc/apt/sources.list** file - ensure to set `CODENAME` to your specific [Debian release name](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases#Production_Releases) (e.g. `bullseye` for Debian 11):

```bash
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/fluentbit-keyring.gpg] https://packages.fluentbit.io/debian/${CODENAME} ${CODENAME} main
```

### Update your repositories database

Now let your system update the _apt_ database:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend upgrading your system (```sudo apt-get upgrade```). This could avoid potential issues with expired certificates.
{% endhint %}


## Install Fluent Bit

Using the following _apt-get_ command you are able now to install the latest _fluent-bit_:

```text
sudo apt-get install fluent-bit
```

Now the following step is to instruct _systemd_ to enable the service:

```bash
sudo service fluent-bit start
```

If you do a status check, you should see a similar output like this:

```bash
sudo service fluent-bit status
