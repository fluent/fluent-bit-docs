# Raspbian / Raspberry Pi

Fluent Bit is distributed as **fluent-bit** package and is available for the Raspberry, specifically for [Raspbian](http://raspbian.org) distribution, the following versions are supported:

## Server GPG key

The first step is to add our server GPG key to your keyring, on that way you can get our signed packages:

```

## Update your sources lists

On Debian and derivative systems such as Raspbian, you need to add our APT server entry to your sources lists, please add the following content at bottom of your **/etc/apt/sources.list** file.

#### Raspbian 11 \(Bullseye\)

```text
deb https://packages.fluentbit.io/raspbian/bullseye bullseye main
```

#### Raspbian 10 \(Buster\)

```text
deb https://packages.fluentbit.io/raspbian/buster buster main
```

### Update your repositories database

Now let your system update the _apt_ database:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
```
