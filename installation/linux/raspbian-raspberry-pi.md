## Update your sources lists

On Debian and derivative systems such as Raspbian, you need to add our APT server entry to your sources lists, please add the following content at bottom of your **/etc/apt/sources.list** file.

### Raspbian 11 \(Bullseye\)

```text
deb https://packages.fluentbit.io/raspbian/bullseye bullseye main
```

### Raspbian 10 \(Buster\)

```text
deb https://packages.fluentbit.io/raspbian/buster buster main
```

### Update your repositories database

Now let your system update the _apt_ database:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend upgrading your system (```sudo apt-get upgrade```). This could avoid potential issues with expired certificates.
{% endhint %}

## Install Fluent Bit

Using the following _apt-get_ command you are able now to install the latest _fluent-bit_:

```text
sudo apt-get install fluent-bit
```

Now the following step is to instruct _systemd_ to enable the service:

```bash
sudo service fluent-bit start
```

If you do a status check, you should see a similar output like this:

```bash
sudo service fluent-bit status
● fluent-bit.service - Fluent Bit
