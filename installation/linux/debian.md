# Debian

Fluent Bit is distributed as the `fluent-bit` package and is available for the latest
stable CentOS system.

The following architectures are supported

- `x86_64`
- `aarch64`
- `arm64v8`

## Single line install

Fluent Bit provides an installation script to use for most Linux targets.
This will always install the most recently released version.

```bash copy
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit/master/install.sh | sh
```

This is a convenience helper and should always be validated prior to use.
The recommended secure deployment approach is to use the following instructions:

## Server GPG key

The first step is to add the Fluent Bit server GPG key to your keyring to ensure
you can get the correct signed packages.

Follow the official
[Debian wiki guidance](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/UseThirdParty#OpenPGP_Key_distribution).

```bash copy
curl https://packages.fluentbit.io/fluentbit.key | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/fluentbit-keyring.gpg
```

### Updated key from March 2022

For the 1.9.0 and 1.8.15 and later releases, the
[GPG key has been updated](https://packages.fluentbit.io/fluentbit.key). Ensure
this new one is added.

The GPG Key fingerprint of the new key is:

```text
C3C0 A285 34B9 293E AF51  FABD 9F9D DC08 3888 C1CD
Fluentbit releases (Releases signing key) <releases@fluentbit.io>
```

The previous key is [still available](https://packages.fluentbit.io/fluentbit-legacy.key)
and might be required to install previous versions.

The GPG Key fingerprint of the old key is:

```text
F209 D876 2A60 CD49 E680 633B 4FF8 368B 6EA0 722A
```

Refer to the [supported platform documentation](../supported-platforms.md) to see
which platforms are supported in each release.

## Update your sources lists

For Debian, you must add the Fluent Bit APT server entry to your sources lists.
Add the following content at bottom of your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file.

```bash copy
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/fluentbit-keyring.gpg] https://packages.fluentbit.io/debian/${CODENAME} ${CODENAME} main
```

Replace _`CODENAME`_ with your specific
[Debian release name](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases#Production\_Releases)
(for example: `bookworm` for Debian 12)

## Update your repositories database

Update your system's `apt` database:

```bash copy
sudo apt-get update
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Fluent Bit recommends upgrading your system (`sudo apt-get upgrade`). This could
avoid potential issues with expired certificates.
{% endhint %}

## Install Fluent Bit

1. Use the following `apt-get` command to install the latest Fluent Bit:

   ```bash copy
   sudo apt-get install fluent-bit
   ```

1. Instruct `systemd` to enable the service:

   ```bash copy
   sudo systemctl start fluent-bit
   ```

If you do a status check, you should see a similar output similar to:

```bash
sudo service fluent-bit status
● fluent-bit.service - Fluent Bit
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/fluent-bit.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since mié 2016-07-06 16:58:25 CST; 2h 45min ago
 Main PID: 6739 (fluent-bit)
    Tasks: 1
   Memory: 656.0K
      CPU: 1.393s
   CGroup: /system.slice/fluent-bit.service
           └─6739 /opt/fluent-bit/bin/fluent-bit -c /etc/fluent-bit/fluent-bit.conf
...
```

The default Fluent Bit configuration collect metrics of CPU usage and sends the
records to the standard output. You can see the outgoing data in your
`/var/log/messages` file.
