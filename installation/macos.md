# macOS

Fluent Bit is compatible with latest Apple macOS system on x86_64 and Apple Silicon M1 architectures.
At the moment there is no official supported package but you can build it from sources by following the instructions below.

## Requirements

For the next steps, you will need to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed in your system.
If is not there, you can install it with the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Installing from Homebrew

The Fluent Bit package on Homebrew is not officially supported, but should work for basic use cases and testing. It can be installed using:

```bash
brew install fluent-bit
```

## Compile from Source

### Install build dependencies

Run the following brew command in your terminal to retrieve the dependencies:

```bash
brew install git cmake openssl bison
```

## Get the source and build it

Grab a fresh copy of the Fluent Bit source code (upstream):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit
cd fluent-bit
```

Optionally, if you want to use a specific version, just checkout to the proper tag.
If you want to use `v1.8.13` just do:

```bash
git checkout v1.8.13
```

In order to prepare the build system, we need to expose certain environment variables so Fluent Bit CMake build rules can pick the right libraries:

```bash
export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=`brew --prefix openssl`
export PATH=`brew --prefix bison`/bin:$PATH
```

Change to the _build/_ directory inside the Fluent Bit sources:

```bash
cd build/
```

Build Fluent Bit.
Note that we are indicating to the build system "where" the final binaries and config files should be installed:

```bash
cmake -DFLB_DEV=on -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/fluent-bit ../
make -j 16
```

Install Fluent Bit to the directory specified above.
Note that this requires root privileges due to the directory we will write information to:

```bash
sudo make install
```

The binaries and configuration examples can be located at `/opt/fluent-bit/`.

## Create macOS installer from source

Grab a fresh copy of the Fluent Bit source code (upstream):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit
cd fluent-bit
```

Optionally, if you want to use a specific version, just checkout to the proper tag. If you want to use `v1.9.2` just do:

```bash
git checkout v1.9.2
```

In order to prepare the build system, we need to expose certain environment variables so Fluent Bit CMake build rules can pick the right libraries:

```bash
export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=`brew --prefix openssl`
export PATH=`brew --prefix bison`/bin:$PATH
```

And then, creating the specific macOS SDK target (For example, specifying macOS Big Sur (11.3) SDK environment):

```bash
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.3
```

Change to the _build/_ directory inside the Fluent Bit sources:

```bash
cd build/
```

Build the Fluent Bit macOS installer.

```bash
cmake -DCPACK_GENERATOR=productbuild -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/fluent-bit ../
make -j 16
cpack -G productbuild
```

Then, macOS installer will be generated as:

```log
CPack: Create package using productbuild
CPack: Install projects
CPack: - Run preinstall target for: fluent-bit
CPack: - Install project: fluent-bit []
CPack: -   Install component: binary
CPack: -   Install component: library
CPack: -   Install component: headers
CPack: -   Install component: headers-extra
CPack: Create package

CPack: -   Building component package: /Users/fluent-bit-builder/GitHub/fluent-bit/build/_CPack_Packages/Darwin/productbuild//Users/fluent-bit-builder/GitHub/fluent-bit/build/fluent-bit-1.9.2-apple/Contents/Packages/fluent-bit-1.9.2-apple-library.pkg
CPack: - package: /Users/fluent-bit-builder/GitHub/fluent-bit/build/fluent-bit-1.9.2-apple.pkg generated.
```

Finally, fluent-bit-`<fluent-bit version>`-`(intel or apple)`.pkg will be generated.

The created installer will put binaries at `/opt/fluent-bit/`.

## Running Fluent Bit

To make the access path easier to Fluent Bit binary, in your terminal extend the `PATH` variable:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/fluent-bit/bin:$PATH
```

Now as a simple test, try Fluent Bit by generating a simple dummy message which will be printed to the standard output interface every 1 second:

```bash
 fluent-bit -i dummy -o stdout -f 1
```

You will see an output similar to this:

```bash
Fluent Bit v1.9.0
