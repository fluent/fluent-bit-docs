# About

[Fluent Bit](http://fluentbit.io) is an open source and multi-platform log forwarder tool which aims to be a generic Swiss knife for log collection and distribution.

We, [Treasure Data](http://treasuredata.com), as a Big Data company, provide an analytics infrastructure in the Cloud where we provide an end-to-end solution to collect, store and do analytics over the data. [Fluent Bit](http://fluentbit.io) is an integral part of this pipeline where it solves the log collection needs.

Being an open source project, it has been widely adopted to solve logging needs in Cloud Native environments where Docker and Kubernetes are key components; Fluent Bit is a natural fit.
