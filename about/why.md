# Why ?

Data collection and log forwarding is hard.

Nowadays the number of sources of information in our environments is ever increasing. Handling data collection at scale is complex, and collecting and aggregating diverse data requires a specialized tool that can deal with:

* Different sources of information.
* Different data formats.
* Multiple destinations.

[Fluent Bit](http://fluentbit.io) was born to address the need for a high performance and optimized tool that can collect data from any input source, unify that data and deliver it to multiple destinations.
