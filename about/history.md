# A Brief History of Fluent Bit

On 2014, the [Fluentd](https://fluentd.org) team at [Treasure Data](https://www.treasuredata.com) forecasted the need of a lightweight log processor for constraint environments like Embedded Linux and Gateways, the project aimed to be part of the Fluentd Ecosystem and we called it [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io), fully open source and available under the terms of the [Apache License v2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

After the project was around for some time, it got some traction in the Embedded market but we also started getting requests for several features from the Cloud community like more inputs, filters, and outputs. Not so long after that, Fluent Bit becomes one of the preferred solutions to solve the logging challenges in Cloud environments.
