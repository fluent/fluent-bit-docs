# A Brief History of Fluent Bit

On 2014, the [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) team at [Treasure Data](https://www.treasuredata.com/) was forecasting the need for a lightweight log processor for constraint environments like Embedded Linux and Gateways, the project aimed to be part of the Fluentd Ecosystem; at that moment, Eduardo created [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/), a new open source solution written from scratch available under the terms of the [Apache License v2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\


After the project was around for some time, it got more traction for normal Linux systems, also with the new containerized world, the Cloud Native community asked to extend the project scope to support more sources, filters, and destinations. Not so long after, Fluent Bit became one of the preferred solutions to solve the logging challenges in Cloud environments.
